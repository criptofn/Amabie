/**
 * THE SECRET GUARD — stored benchmark artifacts must never carry a credential.
 *
 * A live API token was printed into a session log during environment discovery. Benchmark
 * artifacts store whatever an agent writes (final messages, stdout, stderr), and a model can
 * echo an environment value into its own report, so this is not a hypothetical: it is a
 * standing risk of running agents and keeping their words. The harness redacts on the way in
 * (`redact.mjs`), and this test is the OUT-OF-BAND check that the redaction actually held —
 * it reads what is on disk and fails if any credential shape survived.
 *
 * Scan scope: the artifacts this harness produces (results, reports, scratch logs under
 * _canary-data). It deliberately does NOT scan test sources, because `redact.test.mjs` must
 * contain FAKE credential shapes to prove the redactor works; anything that must carry a
 * sample is listed in ALLOWED with a reason.
