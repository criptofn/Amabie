/**
 * ONE BENCHMARK TRIAL — run an AI agent on a task, then verify INDEPENDENTLY.
 *
 * The measurement this exists for, in the user's words: how often does an agent say
 * "I'm done, everything works" when the code is actually broken, and does Amabie's
 * presence change that? So a trial records four SEPARATE facts and never collapses
 * them:
 *
 *   1. WHAT THE AGENT SAID   — its final message, and whether it claims success.
 *   2. WHAT THE VISIBLE SUITE SAYS — the project's own tests, which the agent can edit.
 *   3. WHAT THE HIDDEN ORACLE SAYS — an independent checker the agent never sees.
 *   4. WHAT AMABIE SAYS      — the sealed plan's verdict (only in the amabie arm).
 *
 * A claimed-done that the hidden oracle rejects is a FALSE DONE, and that is the
 * headline number. Tokens, cost, turns and wall time are recorded per trial.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node tooling/benchmark/run-trial.mjs --task bug-sum --arm plain|amabie \
 *        [--label name] [--out <file.json>] [--timeout-min 12] [--keep]
 *
 * Conventions: fixtures live under tooling/benchmark/fixtures/<task>/, the agent works
 * in a fresh COPY of `<task>/project`, and `<task>/hidden/` is never copied in.

 * path), and `amabie bind` then attaches each one to a sealed check.
 *
 * The `workflow` arm is deliberately EXCLUDED: its documented flow has the WORKER declare the
 * requirements through `amabie work --requirement …` (AGENTS.md), and pre-registering them would
 * measure the operator's declaration instead of the worker's. Its prompt carries the fixture's

 * THE CONFIGURATION A FIXTURE IS SUPPOSED TO BE MEASURED IN — declared, not left to whoever runs it.

 * WHY THIS EXISTS (v1.2, MEASURED): the same fixture run under different configurations measures

 * Stop hook; `workflow` drives the candidate flow, so the handoff gate fires; and `guarded` WITH
 * `--register-requirements` is a third configuration again, because a registered-but-unbound
 * requirement makes the Stop hook refuse CORRECT work. That last one turned version-bump from a
 * correctness measurement into a false red with no part of the harness objecting.
 *
 * THE ARM ALONE IS NOT THE CONFIGURATION. A first version of this guard checked only `benchmarkArm`,
 * which cannot distinguish "guarded, no registered requirements" from "guarded, registered" — so it
 * would have accepted the exact run that caused the harm. The configuration therefore has TWO axes and
 * both are checked.
 *
 * A fixture declares:
 *   `benchmarkConfig`:  { arm, registerRequirements }   (or `benchmarkConfigs`: [ ... ])
 * and the older `benchmarkArm` / `benchmarkArms` are still honoured for the arm axis alone.
 *
 * This does NOT block a run — an experiment outside the authored configuration is legitimate, and

 * it on the trial, so a stored result carries the caveat instead of looking like that fixture's
