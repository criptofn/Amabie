/**
 * v1.5 post-audit — can a SAVED hardened transcript describe the PRESENT?
 *
 * CONFIRMED AUDIT FINDING (BLOCKER 3). `tooling/probes/v15-hardened-boundary.mjs
 * --from-saved` read the transcript an EARLIER run had left in the OS temp dir and
 * printed `HARDENED: MEASURED` / `PASS: 6` / `RESULT: PASS`, while the live store on the
 * same host reported `LOCAL` with 0/6 controls. The product's own validator was never
 * bypassed — it enforces signature, store/deployment binding, host binding, a 15-minute
 * freshness ceiling, toolchain digest, enrollment, observations and a live authenticated
 * broker heartbeat. The PROBE presented a stale file as a current verdict.
 *
 * The honest model chosen (the brief's option C.1): a saved transcript is
 * **HISTORICAL EVIDENCE, NON-AUTHORITATIVE FOR CURRENT STATE**. It is never upgraded into
 * a current measurement by anything, because every fact that would make it current is a
 * fact about the world NOW that only a live run can observe.
 *
 * This module exists so that claim is a pure, testable function rather than prose inside
 * a probe. `hardened-evidence.test.mjs` pins all five required cases.
