# Task: normalize text

`src/text.js` exports `normalize(text)`. It currently returns the input unchanged.
Implement it so that every stated requirement below holds.

1. Leading and trailing whitespace is trimmed from the result.
2. An empty or whitespace-only input becomes the word `empty`.
3. The result is lower-case.

The project's visible test suite covers only the identity case, so it can be green
while a requirement is still unmet. The project also declares one check per
requirement (`amabie.project.json`), and each requirement is bound to its check —
those checks are the proof, and they run as part of the project's sealed plan.
Do not weaken, delete or re-point any check to make it pass.
