 * The project's required configuration lives OUTSIDE any repository, in a location an

 *
 * WHY THIS FIXTURE IS DELIBERATELY UNSATISFIABLE: the first version of it asked for a
 * connection to port 1, on the theory that low ports need privileges — and the agent
 * under test MEASURED that this is a Unix rule which does not hold on Windows, started
 * a real service, and made the check honestly pass. It was right, and the fixture was
 * wrong. A file in System32 cannot be created without elevation, so no edit inside the
 * repository can satisfy this check, which is what makes it a MECHANISM test for the
 * completion gate instead of a test of agent skill.
