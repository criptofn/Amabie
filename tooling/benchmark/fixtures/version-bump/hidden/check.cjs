 * THE HIDDEN ORACLE for the version-bump task: thoroughness, measured rather than
 * assumed — but measured FAIRLY.
 *
 * WHY THIS WAS REWRITTEN: its first version forbade the string `1.2.3` anywhere in the
 * repository, which penalised the CORRECT behaviour — a changelog is supposed to keep
 * its historical release entries. MEASURED: a real trial that had updated every place
 * the CURRENT version is claimed was scored as broken because it left `## [1.2.3]` in
 * the changelog (and `.amabie/evidence` contains whatever it contains). A benchmark
 * that marks right answers wrong is worse than no benchmark, so the rule is now
 * "the old version must not be claimed as current", which is the actual requirement.
 *
 * Usage: node check.cjs <projectDir>
