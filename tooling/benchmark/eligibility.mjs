/**
 * v1.5 post-audit — WHICH TRIAL CELLS MAY ENTER A HEADLINE TOKEN AGGREGATE.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (CONFIRMED AUDIT FINDING, BLOCKER 2)
 * ----------------------------------------------------
 * The published v1.5 headline (`83.21 % of Plain, −16.79 %`) pooled twelve cells
 * under one accounting rule. It should not have. `v15-everyday-r2-stateful-replay-guarded-1.json`
 * carries:
 *
 *   agent.exitCode            4294967295      (the process did not exit 0)
 *   agentResult.isError       true
 *   agentResult.parseFailure  true
 *   stream.sawResult          false           (no terminal `result` event)
 *   streamedUsageUsable       false           (the harness itself says this path is unusable)
 *   usage.source              "streamed per-message usage (no result event)"
 *
 * That last line is the defect: the number came from the FALLBACK estimator, not
 * from the declared provider-native ledger the accounting rule names
 * (`result.usage`). Pooling it with eleven provider-native cells silently mixed two
 * incomparable accounting methods — which the release's own accounting rule forbids
 * ("Never mix incomparable accounting methods silently").
 *
 * The rule this module enforces: a cell may contribute to a headline ONLY when its
 * ledger is the declared one AND its run actually completed. Anything else makes the
 * aggregate INCOMPLETE. An incomplete aggregate is never reported as a percentage,
 * because a percentage computed from a dataset with a hole in it is exactly the kind
 * of claim this project exists to prevent.
 *
 * It is a pure function of one record so it can be tested against synthetic
 * adversarial records without running a benchmark (`eligibility.test.mjs`).

 *
 * WHY A HEADLINE NEEDS THIS. v1.5 post-audit, self-inflicted: run `v15-everyday-r3` was
 * started and then the tree was EDITED while it ran, so its six cells carry five different
 * instrument digests (239, 241, 242, 243 files). Every one of those cells is individually
 * eligible — right exit code, right ledger — and the RUN is still not one dataset, because
 * the arms were not measured against the same instrument. A percentage pooled across
 * different instruments is comparing two experiments, not two arms.
 *
 * This is the same class of defect as the fallback-ledger cell: a number that is true of
 * its own cell and meaningless in the aggregate it was poured into.
