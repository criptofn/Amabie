/**
 * THE INSTRUMENT FINGERPRINT.
 *
 * WHY: a benchmark number is meaningless without knowing which instrument produced it. This
 * harness has already corrected four measurement bugs; two of those corrections changed how
 * PAST trials would be scored, and the honest handling of that is to mark the old data with
 * the instrument that produced it rather than to rewrite history. So every trial record and
 * every report carries an `instrument` block:
 *
 *   { version: 'bench-<12 hex>', files: N, hash: '<64 hex>' }
 *
 * The version is a content digest of the HARNESS ITSELF (every module in this directory)
 * plus every FIXTURE (project files, hidden oracles, task text, fixture metadata). Changing a
 * prompt, an oracle, a fixture or the verdict logic therefore changes the version, and any
 * result can be attributed to the exact instrument that produced it.
 *
 * `results/` and `scratch/` are excluded on purpose: they are the instrument's OUTPUT, and
 * including them would make the fingerprint change every time a trial ran.

/**
 * Documentation is not the instrument.
 *
 * MEASURED problem this fixes: `BENCHMARKS.md` and `RESULTS.md` used to be part of the digest, so
 * writing up a finished matrix moved the version and the NEXT trial in a running batch recorded a
 * different instrument than the ones before it — for a doc edit that changes no rule. Fixture task
 * text (`fixtures/<task>/TASK.md`) IS part of the instrument and stays in: the model reads it.

 * rebuild between two trials of the same matrix therefore changes what was measured, and the

 * running batch, and being unable to tell from the instrument block whether the later trials ran
