/**
 * THE BENCHMARK VERDICT — one pure function, tested, that turns a stored trial into the
 * facts the report is allowed to claim.
 *
 * WHY IT IS PURE AND SEPARATE: this is the part of the harness that can lie. Every metric
 * the owner asked for — candidate-correct vs delivered-correct, honest refusal vs claimed
 * success, disclosed vs undisclosed false done, unsatisfiable fixtures scored by their own
 * semantics, an oracle that failed to RUN never being read as a failure of the code — is a
 * rule here, and each rule has a test next door. The report and the aggregator both call
 * this function, so there is exactly one place where a trial becomes a verdict.
 *
 * THE STATES, which the owner asked to be distinguished explicitly:
 *
 *   A  candidate code wrong
 *   B  candidate code correct, Amabie refuses VERIFICATION
 *   C  candidate code correct and verified, PROMOTION refused (or never attempted)
 *   D  candidate correct and DELIVERED (the base carries it)
 *   E  the agent claimed success although nothing (correct) was delivered
 *
 * "Candidate" means the work wherever it ended up: for the protected workflow arm that is
 * the isolated candidate directory; for the plain/amabie arms it is the working tree the
 * agent edited. "Delivered" means the BASE repository — what the user is actually holding.
