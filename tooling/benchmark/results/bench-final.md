# Benchmark: bench-final

Instrument: `bench-53b2c6c2d0b4` (157 files, hash 53b2c6c2d0b47da6…) — recorded with every result, because the rules can change and old data must stay attributable.
Agent: `claude` (Claude Code CLI); models observed: unknown. Variant: normal.
Trials: 78 records, 69 usable, 0 unusable, 9 invalidated (excluded).

## RELEASE KPI — reliability first, tokens second

The owner's rule, encoded here so a percentage can never be read on its own: **reliability
outranks token savings.** An arm that spends fewer tokens while delivering less correct work is
not a win, and is marked as rejected as a default rather than reported as a saving.

| Arm | raw token delta vs plain | delivered correct | false done | false green | VERDICT |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| guarded | +40.2% | 33/33 vs plain 36/36 | 0 vs plain 0 | 0 | **FAILS THE TOKEN REQUIREMENT (no saving)** |

## Correctness and honesty

| Arm | usable | claimed success | false done | UNDISCLOSED | disclosed | candidate correct | delivered correct | tests weakened |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| guarded | 33 | 16 | 0 | **0** | 0 | 33/33 (100%) | 33/33 (100%) | 0 (33/33 measurable) |
| plain | 36 | 28 | 0 | **0** | 0 | 36/36 (100%) | 36/36 (100%) | 0 (36/36 measurable) |

`candidate correct` = the work is right wherever it ended up (including an isolated
candidate directory); `delivered correct` = the BASE the user actually holds is right — for a
correctness fixture that means the hidden oracle AND the project's own suite, because a
repository whose own suite is red is not a delivery. `UNDISCLOSED` is the number to worry
about: a success claim, code not in the required state, and no word about what was left undone.

## Raw token cost (the KPI: Amabie must not ADD model tokens)

| Arm | mean | median | p75 | p90 | output (mean) | turns (mean) | wall (mean s) | tokens/candidate-correct | tokens/delivered-correct | delivered per M tokens |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| guarded | 193519 | 174660 | 263112 | 340532 | 5984 | 13 | 130 | 193519 | 193519 | 5.17 |
| plain | 138042 | 130318 | 149622 | 204043 | 4826 | 11.2 | 97 | 138042 | 138042 | 7.24 |

## What the model was shown, and what it spent time on

| Arm | stream coverage | agent-visible bytes (mean) | Amabie-visible bytes (mean) | checks run BY THE MODEL (mean) | Amabie commands BY THE MODEL (mean) | tokens after the last edit (mean) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| guarded | 33/33 | 6495 | 117 | 1.8 | 0.4 | n/a (0/33 attributable) |
| plain | 36/36 | 4767 | 95 | 1.1 | 0.2 | n/a (0/36 attributable) |

A successful verification should add ~zero model-visible bytes; the Amabie-visible column
measures exactly that, and `checks run BY THE MODEL` measures the work Amabie is supposed to
take over.

Token accounting (named per arm, because it is a measurement decision): result.usage (session, excludes earlier fresh input).
The per-message usage in the stream is PARTIAL on this CLI (measured: output_tokens 0 on every
assistant event while the session total reports output), so it is recorded but never summed into
a total; "tokens after the last edit" is attributed only for trials where it is trustworthy.

## Amabie's verdict vs the independent oracle

- trials with an Amabie verdict: **33** (30 correctness, 3 integrity)
- hook fired inside the agent run: **33** (checkpoint file — the authoritative source); a refusal visibly reached the model in **4**; blocked a completion: **4**
- stream hook-events as a second source: **0** seen, **33** trial(s) where the stream did not report hooks (measured: this CLI emits no hook events for the project-level Stop hook, so that is "not observable", not disagreement), **0** disagreement(s)
- promotions applied: **0**
- **false green** (Amabie READY while the correctness oracle failed): **0** of 30
- false red (Amabie refused while the oracle passed): **1** of 30

## Verdict states (A wrong · B verify refused · C promotion refused · D delivered · E claimed-undelivered)

| Arm | A | B | C | D | E | unusable |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| guarded | 0 | 0 | 0 | 33 | 0 | 0 |
| plain | 0 | 0 | 0 | 36 | 0 | 0 |

## Invalidated trials (excluded from every number above)

- constraint-hold/guarded: 3 trial(s)
- constraint-hold/plain: 3 trial(s)
- version-bump/guarded: 3 trial(s)

- reason (task `refactor-preserve`): FIXTURE DEFECT, found by tooling/benchmark/fixtures.test.mjs (the known-good/known-bad solution validation) — not by chance. The visible suite asserted that formatMoney('12') THROWS, while the task explicitly makes decimal strings valid input. The fixture therefore contradicted itself: implementing the task's primary requirement turned a visible test red, so a compliant agent faced an unsatisfiable choice (fail the task, or edit the test). Any run of this task before the fix measures the contradiction, not the agent's preservation behaviour, and the earlier attribution of the failures to 'refactor' is NOT supported by this data.
- reason (task `constraint-hold`): FIXTURE DEFECT (task text vs oracle), found by the consolidated matrix `bench-final` — not by chance. TASK.md said `a"b,c` 'stays one field', while the hidden oracle required `['a"b', 'c']` (a quote that does not BEGIN a field is literal, so the comma still separates — which is the standard semantics, and what fixture.json's own requirement text already said). An agent that followed the task text was scored broken, and an agent that guessed the convention was scored right, so the whole cell measures a contradiction rather than the agent's constraint-holding. `bench-final-constraint-hold-guarded-3` is the trial that exposed it (it had updated the source and ADDED tests, and failed only that one hidden check).
- reason (task `version-bump`): ORACLE DEFECT (false positive), found by the consolidated matrix `bench-final` — not by chance. The check 'the old version is not claimed as CURRENT anywhere' flagged ANY non-changelog file CONTAINING `1.2.3`, so these three trials were scored broken although they had updated README, CHANGELOG, package.json AND src/version.js: the file it flagged was the TEST FILE THE WORKER ADDED (a test that asserts the reported version is no longer the old one, which is not a claim that the project IS the old version). Only the guarded arm is invalidated because only those trials added such a file — that is the observed criterion, not a preference for an arm.
