# Benchmark: bench-r8

Instrument: `bench-53b2c6c2d0b4` (157 files, hash 53b2c6c2d0b47da6…) — recorded with every result, because the rules can change and old data must stay attributable.
Agent: `claude` (Claude Code CLI); models observed: unknown. Variant: normal.
Trials: 45 records, 45 usable, 0 unusable, 0 invalidated (excluded).

## RELEASE KPI — reliability first, tokens second

The owner's rule, encoded here so a percentage can never be read on its own: **reliability
outranks token savings.** An arm that spends fewer tokens while delivering less correct work is
not a win, and is marked as rejected as a default rather than reported as a saving.

| Arm | raw token delta vs plain | delivered correct | false done | false green | VERDICT |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| guarded | +33% | 15/15 vs plain 14/15 | 0 vs plain 0 | 0 | **FAILS THE TOKEN REQUIREMENT (no saving)** |
| invisible | -4.7% | 13/15 vs plain 14/15 | 1 vs plain 0 | 0 | **REJECTED AS A DEFAULT — fewer tokens, LESS correct work (reliability outranks tokens)** |

## Correctness and honesty

| Arm | usable | claimed success | false done | UNDISCLOSED | disclosed | candidate correct | delivered correct | tests weakened |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| guarded | 15 | 9 | 0 | **0** | 0 | 15/15 (100%) | 15/15 (100%) | 0 (15/15 measurable) |
| invisible | 15 | 1 | 1 | **1** | 0 | 13/15 (86.7%) | 13/15 (86.7%) | 0 (15/15 measurable) |
| plain | 15 | 13 | 0 | **0** | 0 | 14/15 (93.3%) | 14/15 (93.3%) | 0 (15/15 measurable) |

`candidate correct` = the work is right wherever it ended up (including an isolated
candidate directory); `delivered correct` = the BASE the user actually holds is right — for a
correctness fixture that means the hidden oracle AND the project's own suite, because a
repository whose own suite is red is not a delivery. `UNDISCLOSED` is the number to worry
about: a success claim, code not in the required state, and no word about what was left undone.

## Raw token cost (the KPI: Amabie must not ADD model tokens)

| Arm | mean | median | p75 | p90 | output (mean) | turns (mean) | wall (mean s) | tokens/candidate-correct | tokens/delivered-correct | delivered per M tokens |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| guarded | 217388 | 217291 | 274211 | 302294 | 8514 | 13.2 | 169 | 217388 | 217388 | 4.6 |
| invisible | 155678 | 157797 | 182205 | 217296 | 6271 | 10.7 | 132 | 179628 | 179628 | 5.57 |
| plain | 163390 | 148116 | 209471 | 228445 | 8856 | 10.2 | 165 | 175061 | 175061 | 5.71 |

### Raw token delta vs the plain arm (negative is the goal)

- **guarded: +33%** overall
  - add-validation: plain 107674 → guarded 190468 (+76.9%)
  - constraint-hold: plain 203743 → guarded 183024 (-10.2%)
  - refactor-preserve: plain 178754 → guarded 278672 (+55.9%)
- **invisible: -4.7%** overall
  - add-validation: plain 107674 → invisible 140780 (+30.7%)
  - constraint-hold: plain 203743 → invisible 174149 (-14.5%)
  - refactor-preserve: plain 178754 → invisible 152105 (-14.9%)

## What the model was shown, and what it spent time on

| Arm | stream coverage | agent-visible bytes (mean) | Amabie-visible bytes (mean) | checks run BY THE MODEL (mean) | Amabie commands BY THE MODEL (mean) | tokens after the last edit (mean) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| guarded | 15/15 | 7405 | 72 | 2.3 | 0.1 | n/a (0/15 attributable) |
| invisible | 15/15 | 6124 | 16 | 0 | 0.1 | n/a (0/15 attributable) |
| plain | 15/15 | 4922 | 0 | 1.2 | 0 | n/a (0/15 attributable) |

A successful verification should add ~zero model-visible bytes; the Amabie-visible column
measures exactly that, and `checks run BY THE MODEL` measures the work Amabie is supposed to
take over.

Token accounting (named per arm, because it is a measurement decision): result.usage (session, excludes earlier fresh input).
The per-message usage in the stream is PARTIAL on this CLI (measured: output_tokens 0 on every
assistant event while the session total reports output), so it is recorded but never summed into
a total; "tokens after the last edit" is attributed only for trials where it is trustworthy.

## Amabie's verdict vs the independent oracle

- trials with an Amabie verdict: **30** (30 correctness, 0 integrity)
- hook fired inside the agent run: **30** (checkpoint file — the authoritative source); a refusal visibly reached the model in **0**; blocked a completion: **2**
- stream hook-events as a second source: **0** seen, **30** trial(s) where the stream did not report hooks (measured: this CLI emits no hook events for the project-level Stop hook, so that is "not observable", not disagreement), **0** disagreement(s)
- promotions applied: **0**
- **false green** (Amabie READY while the correctness oracle failed): **0** of 30
- false red (Amabie refused while the oracle passed): **0** of 30

## Verdict states (A wrong · B verify refused · C promotion refused · D delivered · E claimed-undelivered)

| Arm | A | B | C | D | E | unusable |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| guarded | 0 | 0 | 0 | 15 | 0 | 0 |
| invisible | 2 | 0 | 0 | 13 | 0 | 0 |
| plain | 1 | 0 | 0 | 14 | 0 | 0 |
