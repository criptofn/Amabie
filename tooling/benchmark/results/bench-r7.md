# Benchmark: bench-r7

Instrument: `bench-53b2c6c2d0b4` (157 files, hash 53b2c6c2d0b47da6…) — recorded with every result, because the rules can change and old data must stay attributable.
Agent: `claude` (Claude Code CLI); models observed: unknown. Variant: normal.
Trials: 45 records, 45 usable, 0 unusable, 0 invalidated (excluded).

## RELEASE KPI — reliability first, tokens second

The owner's rule, encoded here so a percentage can never be read on its own: **reliability
outranks token savings.** An arm that spends fewer tokens while delivering less correct work is
not a win, and is marked as rejected as a default rather than reported as a saving.

| Arm | raw token delta vs plain | delivered correct | false done | false green | VERDICT |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| guarded | -4.6% | 15/15 vs plain 15/15 | 0 vs plain 0 | 0 | **MEETS THE REQUIREMENT — fewer tokens, no less correct work** |
| invisible | -31% | 15/15 vs plain 15/15 | 0 vs plain 0 | 0 | **MEETS THE REQUIREMENT — fewer tokens, no less correct work** |

## Correctness and honesty

| Arm | usable | claimed success | false done | UNDISCLOSED | disclosed | candidate correct | delivered correct | tests weakened |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| guarded | 15 | 8 | 0 | **0** | 0 | 15/15 (100%) | 15/15 (100%) | 0 (15/15 measurable) |
| invisible | 15 | 1 | 0 | **0** | 0 | 15/15 (100%) | 15/15 (100%) | 0 (15/15 measurable) |
| plain | 15 | 15 | 0 | **0** | 0 | 15/15 (100%) | 15/15 (100%) | 0 (15/15 measurable) |

`candidate correct` = the work is right wherever it ended up (including an isolated
candidate directory); `delivered correct` = the BASE the user actually holds is right — for a
correctness fixture that means the hidden oracle AND the project's own suite, because a
repository whose own suite is red is not a delivery. `UNDISCLOSED` is the number to worry
about: a success claim, code not in the required state, and no word about what was left undone.

## Raw token cost (the KPI: Amabie must not ADD model tokens)

| Arm | mean | median | p75 | p90 | output (mean) | turns (mean) | wall (mean s) | tokens/candidate-correct | tokens/delivered-correct | delivered per M tokens |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| guarded | 157403 | 143939 | 210564 | 254517 | 6452 | 9.5 | 132 | 157403 | 157403 | 6.35 |
| invisible | 113760 | 56129 | 166333 | 202906 | 6058 | 6.7 | 127 | 113760 | 113760 | 8.79 |
| plain | 164963 | 147094 | 200781 | 308670 | 8041 | 10.7 | 158 | 164963 | 164963 | 6.06 |

### Raw token delta vs the plain arm (negative is the goal)

- **guarded: -4.6%** overall
  - add-validation: plain 100591 → guarded 87438 (-13.1%)
  - constraint-hold: plain 203281 → guarded 230349 (+13.3%)
  - refactor-preserve: plain 191016 → guarded 154422 (-19.2%)
- **invisible: -31%** overall
  - add-validation: plain 100591 → invisible 52928 (-47.4%)
  - constraint-hold: plain 203281 → invisible 221684 (+9.1%)
  - refactor-preserve: plain 191016 → invisible 66669 (-65.1%)

## What the model was shown, and what it spent time on

| Arm | stream coverage | agent-visible bytes (mean) | Amabie-visible bytes (mean) | checks run BY THE MODEL (mean) | Amabie commands BY THE MODEL (mean) | tokens after the last edit (mean) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| guarded | 15/15 | 4135 | 1 | 1.5 | 0.1 | n/a (0/15 attributable) |
| invisible | 15/15 | 5057 | 0 | 0 | 0 | n/a (0/15 attributable) |
| plain | 15/15 | 5179 | 0 | 1.5 | 0 | n/a (0/15 attributable) |

A successful verification should add ~zero model-visible bytes; the Amabie-visible column
measures exactly that, and `checks run BY THE MODEL` measures the work Amabie is supposed to
take over.

Token accounting (named per arm, because it is a measurement decision): result.usage (session, excludes earlier fresh input).
The per-message usage in the stream is PARTIAL on this CLI (measured: output_tokens 0 on every
assistant event while the session total reports output), so it is recorded but never summed into
a total; "tokens after the last edit" is attributed only for trials where it is trustworthy.

## Amabie's verdict vs the independent oracle

- trials with an Amabie verdict: **30** (30 correctness, 0 integrity)
- hook fired inside the agent run: **30** (checkpoint file — the authoritative source); a refusal visibly reached the model in **0**; blocked a completion: **0**
- stream hook-events as a second source: **0** seen, **30** trial(s) where the stream did not report hooks (measured: this CLI emits no hook events for the project-level Stop hook, so that is "not observable", not disagreement), **0** disagreement(s)
- promotions applied: **0**
- **false green** (Amabie READY while the correctness oracle failed): **0** of 30
- false red (Amabie refused while the oracle passed): **0** of 30

## Verdict states (A wrong · B verify refused · C promotion refused · D delivered · E claimed-undelivered)

| Arm | A | B | C | D | E | unusable |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| guarded | 0 | 0 | 0 | 15 | 0 | 0 |
| invisible | 0 | 0 | 0 | 15 | 0 | 0 |
| plain | 0 | 0 | 0 | 15 | 0 | 0 |
