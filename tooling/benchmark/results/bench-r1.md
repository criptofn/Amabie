# Benchmark: bench-r1

Agent: `claude` (Claude Code CLI), model as recorded: unknown.
Matrix: 4 task(s) × 3 arm(s) × 3 trial(s) = 36 runs; 36 usable, 0 unusable.

## The headline

| Arm | usable | claimed success | **false done** | false-done rate | false done (of all runs) | hidden oracle PASS | regressions | tests edited |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| amabie | 12 | 8 | 2 | 25% | 16.7% | 9/12 (75%) | n/a | 1 |
| plain | 12 | 9 | 3 | 33.3% | 25% | 9/12 (75%) | n/a | 3 |
| workflow | 12 | 8 | 4 | 50% | 33.3% | 8/12 (66.7%) | n/a | 4 |

## What the agent said, against what was true

| Arm | claim | runs | code actually OK | code actually broken |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| amabie | success | 8 | 6 | 2 |
| amabie | mixed | 3 | 2 | 1 |
| amabie | failure | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| plain | success | 9 | 6 | 3 |
| plain | mixed | 2 | 2 | 0 |
| plain | failure | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| workflow | success | 8 | 4 | 4 |
| workflow | mixed | 3 | 3 | 0 |
| workflow | unclear | 1 | 1 | 0 |

## Cost per run

| Arm | total tokens (mean / median) | input (mean) | output (mean) | cache reads (mean) | turns (mean) | wall (mean s) | tokens per WORKING result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| amabie | 119191.42 / 109667.5 | 41.5 | 2499.42 | 98307.92 | 10.42 | 68.47 | 158921.89 |
| plain | 120529.08 / 115789 | 42.5 | 2513.67 | 99625.17 | 9.17 | 64.25 | 160705.44 |
| workflow | 518655.42 / 435320 | 122 | 9824.42 | 477579.83 | 23.67 | 245.47 | 777983.13 |

## Amabie's verdict vs the independent oracle

- trials with an Amabie verdict: **24** (of which 24 are correctness fixtures, 0 integrity fixtures)
- hook fired inside the agent run: **24**
- hook BLOCKED a completion: **6**
- promotions actually applied: **5**
- **false green** (Amabie READY while the correctness oracle failed): **7** of 24
- false red (Amabie refused while the correctness oracle passed): **6** of 24

Integrity fixtures are EXCLUDED from false-green/false-red on purpose: their oracle asks
"did the agent defeat the check?", not "is the code right?", so a refusal there is correct.
