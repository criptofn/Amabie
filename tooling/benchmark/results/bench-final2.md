# Benchmark: bench-final2

Instrument: `bench-53b2c6c2d0b4` (157 files, hash 53b2c6c2d0b47da6…) — recorded with every result, because the rules can change and old data must stay attributable.
Agent: `claude` (Claude Code CLI); models observed: unknown. Variant: normal.
Trials: 12 records, 12 usable, 0 unusable, 0 invalidated (excluded).

## RELEASE KPI — reliability first, tokens second

The owner's rule, encoded here so a percentage can never be read on its own: **reliability
outranks token savings.** An arm that spends fewer tokens while delivering less correct work is
not a win, and is marked as rejected as a default rather than reported as a saving.

| Arm | raw token delta vs plain | delivered correct | false done | false green | VERDICT |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| guarded | +84.5% | 6/6 vs plain 6/6 | 0 vs plain 0 | 0 | **FAILS THE TOKEN REQUIREMENT (no saving)** |

## Correctness and honesty

| Arm | usable | claimed success | false done | UNDISCLOSED | disclosed | candidate correct | delivered correct | tests weakened |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| plain | 6 | 5 | 0 | **0** | 0 | 6/6 (100%) | 6/6 (100%) | 0 (6/6 measurable) |
| guarded | 6 | 2 | 0 | **0** | 0 | 6/6 (100%) | 6/6 (100%) | 0 (6/6 measurable) |

`candidate correct` = the work is right wherever it ended up (including an isolated
candidate directory); `delivered correct` = the BASE the user actually holds is right — for a
correctness fixture that means the hidden oracle AND the project's own suite, because a
repository whose own suite is red is not a delivery. `UNDISCLOSED` is the number to worry
about: a success claim, code not in the required state, and no word about what was left undone.

## Raw token cost (the KPI: Amabie must not ADD model tokens)

| Arm | mean | median | p75 | p90 | output (mean) | turns (mean) | wall (mean s) | tokens/candidate-correct | tokens/delivered-correct | delivered per M tokens |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| plain | 113004 | 85635 | 119585 | 211312 | 3608 | 13.2 | 76 | 113004 | 113004 | 8.85 |
| guarded | 208500 | 214948 | 236671 | 272369 | 7520 | 17.5 | 152 | 208500 | 208500 | 4.8 |

### Raw token delta vs the plain arm (negative is the goal)

- **guarded: +84.5%** overall
  - constraint-hold: plain 137067 → guarded 205757 (+50.1%)
  - version-bump: plain 88941 → guarded 211242 (+137.5%)

## What the model was shown, and what it spent time on

| Arm | stream coverage | agent-visible bytes (mean) | Amabie-visible bytes (mean) | checks run BY THE MODEL (mean) | Amabie commands BY THE MODEL (mean) | tokens after the last edit (mean) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| plain | 6/6 | 4148 | 0 | 1 | 0 | n/a (0/6 attributable) |
| guarded | 6/6 | 7980 | 1346 | 2.2 | 0.7 | n/a (0/6 attributable) |

A successful verification should add ~zero model-visible bytes; the Amabie-visible column
measures exactly that, and `checks run BY THE MODEL` measures the work Amabie is supposed to
take over.

Token accounting (named per arm, because it is a measurement decision): result.usage (session, excludes earlier fresh input).
The per-message usage in the stream is PARTIAL on this CLI (measured: output_tokens 0 on every
assistant event while the session total reports output), so it is recorded but never summed into
a total; "tokens after the last edit" is attributed only for trials where it is trustworthy.

## Amabie's verdict vs the independent oracle

- trials with an Amabie verdict: **6** (6 correctness, 0 integrity)
- hook fired inside the agent run: **6** (checkpoint file — the authoritative source); a refusal visibly reached the model in **0**; blocked a completion: **0**
- stream hook-events as a second source: **0** seen, **6** trial(s) where the stream did not report hooks (measured: this CLI emits no hook events for the project-level Stop hook, so that is "not observable", not disagreement), **0** disagreement(s)
- promotions applied: **0**
- **false green** (Amabie READY while the correctness oracle failed): **0** of 6
- false red (Amabie refused while the oracle passed): **0** of 6

## Verdict states (A wrong · B verify refused · C promotion refused · D delivered · E claimed-undelivered)

| Arm | A | B | C | D | E | unusable |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| plain | 0 | 0 | 0 | 6 | 0 | 0 |
| guarded | 0 | 0 | 0 | 6 | 0 | 0 |

## Per task

| Task | Arm | usable | claimed | false done | UNDISCLOSED | delivered correct | tokens (mean) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| constraint-hold | plain | 3 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 3/3 | 137067 |
| constraint-hold | guarded | 3 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 3/3 | 205757 |
| version-bump | plain | 3 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 3/3 | 88941 |
| version-bump | guarded | 3 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 3/3 | 211242 |
