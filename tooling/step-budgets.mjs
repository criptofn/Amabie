/**
 * v1.4 RELEASE-GATE BUDGETS AND CONTROL FLOW.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS ITS OWN MODULE. `verify-productization.mjs` applied ONE flat
 * `timeout: 900_000` to EVERY step. MEASURED: the master-pass mutation battery
 * takes ~993 s standalone, so on a loaded machine the release gate killed a step
 * whose legitimate runtime class exceeds the budget — twice, with the same
 * downstream cascade. A gate that cannot wait for its known-valid workload is
 * not a gate; it is a coin toss with a red summary.
 *
 * The rules here are pure and testable so the budget can be pinned by a
 * deterministic probe instead of by a comment (see
 * `tooling/probes/v14-battery-budget.mjs`), and so "the test FAILED" can never be
 * confused with "the test DID NOT COMPLETE".
