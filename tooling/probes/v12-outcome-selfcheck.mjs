/**
 * v1.2 outcome-instrument self-check.
 *
 * WHY A PROBE AND NOT ONLY A SUITE TEST: the rules here decide whether Amabie beat a plain
 * agent on a false-done benchmark, so they must be checkable on any host — including one whose
 * sandbox refuses the `node --test` runner's child-process stdio (measured on this host:
 * `spawn EPERM`). `outcome.test.mjs` runs the same cases inside the repository suite; this
 * probe runs them standalone and prints a reviewable PASS/FAIL line per rule.
 *
 * It spends no model tokens and needs no network.
 *
 * Usage: node tooling/probes/v12-outcome-selfcheck.mjs
 * Exit:  0 when every rule held, 1 otherwise.
