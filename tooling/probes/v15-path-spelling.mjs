/**
 * v1.5 post-audit — TWO SPELLINGS OF ONE DIRECTORY (the last Windows CI blocker, made portable).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The Windows CI leg failed one test:
 *
 *   not ok 1 - setup accepts --toolchain-dir with spaces, records it, and the sealed step sees it
 *     the authorized directory never reached the child PATH
 *
 * The directory WAS on the child's PATH. The check compared the PATH against the path AS THE TEST
 * SPELLED IT, while the product seals `fs.realpathSync.native(dir)` — deliberately, because a
 * canonical path is what stops a symlink being swapped after sealing. On a runner whose TEMP is the
 * 8.3 short form (`...\RUNNER~1\...`) the two spellings differ, so a raw `includes` failed.
 *
 * That is the same class as the v1.4 Windows failure: ONE ASSERTION COMPARING TWO SPELLINGS OF ONE
 * DIRECTORY.
 *
 * The CI host is the only place 8.3 short names are guaranteed, and this machine has them DISABLED
 * (`dir /x` shows no alias), so the runner condition cannot be reproduced here directly. A directory
 * JUNCTION produces the same shape portably: two spellings, one directory. This probe builds that,
 * measures both spellings, and proves:
 *
 *   1. the product seals the CANONICAL spelling and the sealed child really receives that directory;
 *   2. a RAW exact-spelling comparison would report "the authorized directory never reached the child
 *      PATH" — i.e. it reproduces the CI failure's symptom WITHOUT a short name, which pins the
 *      mechanism rather than assuming it;
 *   3. a canonical comparison (what the fixed test now does) sees the directory, so the fix addresses
 *      the cause and not the symptom;
 *   4. a directory that is genuinely ABSENT is still refused by the canonical comparison — the fix
 *      did not relax the check into always-passing.
 *
 * Fixtures live only in the OS temp dir. Prints PASS/FAIL; exits 0 only if every case held.
