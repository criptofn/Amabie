// v1.3 §23 — HOW LONG DOES THE PROJECT'S OWN CHECK TAKE? (the number B2 assumed instead of measuring)
//
// The confined-transport analysis concluded that returning the project's own check result after each
// `implement` batch would blow the transport's 15-minute ceiling. That conclusion rested on an ASSUMPTION
// written into the probe as if it were a fact — "a suite that takes a minute" — and the assumption was
// never measured. It matters, because the fixtures' checks are small and fast, and the worker's own 36
// `exec` calls each cost a full model turn (~34 s at the recorded pace). If the check itself is cheap, the
// round trips are the expense and auto-running it costs seconds, not minutes — which would REOPEN the
// design rather than close it.
//
// So this probe measures the cost input directly: materialise the fixture the way the harness does (into
// its own directory, outside this repository, whose package.json says "type": "module" and would otherwise
// decide how the fixture's CommonJS files are parsed), then time the check the manifest declares.
