/**
 * IS THE "PLAIN" ARM ACTUALLY PLAIN? — global agent memory, measured.
 *
 * The benchmark's plain arm is the baseline the token claim is measured against, so it must not
 * carry guidance the other arm does not. `--setting-sources project,local` removes user SETTINGS
 * (hooks, plugins, the API env block, which the harness forwards explicitly), but the machine also
 * has a global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` — agent MEMORY, a different mechanism — and that file mentions
 * Amabie and says to "avoid redundant self-verification when deterministic project tooling or
 * Amabie can perform the same check independently". That is, almost word for word, the instruction
 * the `invisible` arm is supposed to be measured against.
 *
 * MEASURED evidence that this is not hypothetical: one plain-arm trial invoked `amabie status`
 * (bench-r6-cross-file-refactor-plain-1), a command nothing in that fixture mentions.
 *
 * This probe asks the model itself, in a throwaway project, whether it was given project-specific
 * notes about other repositories:
 *   - run A: exactly the benchmark's environment;
 *   - run B: the same, with the CLI's config home redirected to an empty temp dir (the candidate
 *     fix — it must still authenticate from the FORWARDED env, which is what run B checks).
 * It reports whether memory surfaced, whether the redirected run works at all, and its token cost.
 *
 * MEASURED RESULT, which is why the confound is DISCLOSED rather than fixed: run A quoted the
 * machine-global memory verbatim, and run B — with HOME/USERPROFILE/HOMEDRIVE/HOMEPATH pointed at
 * an empty temp directory — quoted the SAME file. Redirection does not remove it. The one remaining
 * mechanism that does (`--bare`) also skips HOOKS, which is the protected arm's entire gate, so it
 * cannot be used here.
 *
 * What that means for the token claim, stated where it belongs: BOTH arms see this memory, so the
 * arm-to-arm comparison stays internally valid — but the "plain" arm is not an Amabie-naive user.
 * It already carries "avoid redundant self-verification when deterministic project tooling or Amabie
 * can perform the same check independently", i.e. a rough paraphrase of the invisible arm's own
 * instruction, and one plain trial really did invoke `amabie status`. If anything that makes the
 * measured saving an UNDER-estimate of what a naive user would see, and it is reported as such.
 *
 * Usage: node tooling/probes/agent-memory-visible.mjs
