/**
 * v1.1 item E — the HARDENED boundary, measured instead of asserted.
 *
 * `HARDENED` is a claim that a *different OS identity* stands between candidate
 * code and Amabie's authority. That claim is either measurable on the host or it
 * is not made. This probe does two jobs:
 *
 *   1. TRIPWIRE. It reads the product's own capability surface (the compiled
 *      `platform-boundary.js`) and FAILS if Amabie would report `HARDENED`, or
 *      would report fewer than all six boundary controls unavailable, while no
 *      installed provider has been proven. Overclaiming protection must break a
 *      build, not merely be discouraged in prose.
 *   2. MEASUREMENT + EXACT ASK. For each of the six controls it establishes why
 *      the control is unavailable ON THIS HOST — not "not implemented", but the
 *      concrete missing piece — and prints the precise privileged command a
 *      human would have to run. The user's instruction is to implement
 *      everything possible first and stop only for that specific authorization;
 *      this is the artefact that makes the stop exact rather than vague.
 *
 * It never installs anything, never requests elevation and never writes outside
 * the OS temp dir. Exit 0 means "the honest posture holds and is measured".
