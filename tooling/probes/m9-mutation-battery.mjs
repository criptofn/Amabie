/**
 * M9 mutation battery — deterministic kill checks for the authority guard.
 *
 * Same convention as the m7/m8 batteries: mutate the BUILT dist bytes (a
 * gitignored artifact), run the ONE probe that owns that gate (real-git M9
 * authority probe), require IT to fail with the owning scenario's FAIL line,
 * restore and byte-compare. A guard whose removal breaks nothing is a guard
 * no check actually pins. Exit 0 only when every mutation was caught.
 * NO PROOF, NO DONE.
 *
 * 15 mutations, each anchored to a compiled substring whose occurrence count
 * is asserted before mutating — anchor drift fails loudly. Both window arms
 * read through the one inWindowDrift(), so the evidence mutation pins plant,
 * edit AND wipe on both edges at once; mutations 11–15 pin the review
 * hardening: the verifier-code tree (F1), the quarantine refusal (F2), the
 * stamp (F2), the post-window seal recheck (F3) and the base-HEAD token (F4).
 *
 * Deliberately NOT mutated — no deterministic trigger in this layer, recorded
 * honestly rather than oversold:
 *  - the THROW-arm checks (`threwDrift`, `threwSeal`): reaching them requires
 *    a sealed plan whose step is refused by stepArgv AFTER an earlier step
 *    mutated authority — a refused script name can never be sealed via setup,
 *    so the arms are defensive redundancy over the same authorityDrift /
 *    sealViolation calls that mutations 1/6/9/14 already pin.
 *  - the CLI_ENTRY list item: hand-tampering it would mutate the RUNNING
 *    dist mid-test and destroy the subject. Its mechanism is no longer
 *    unpinned, though — mutation 11 removes the dist/src tree fingerprint
 *    that covers the whole import graph (main.js, candidate.js included),
 *    and the probe's verifier-code scenario proves it on a sibling file.
 *  - change-and-revert strictly inside one window: a single-threaded
 *    sandwich cannot witness it (same honest ceiling as M8's identity
 *    sandwich; M19 persistence narrows the human-visible gap).
 *  - shortState() and the UNREADABLE token plumbing: display/fail-closed
 *    construction; the authority is the comparison itself, pinned via the
 *    settingsdrop ABSENT-token scenario (dropping settings from the list is
 *    mutation 7).
 *  - promote-side enforcement: gate 1 (`v.code !== 0`) is the m8 battery's
 *    subject, and the §9 mandate rides the same VerifyOutcome it pins.
