/**
 * DOC CONSISTENCY — do the numbers in the release documents match the repository?
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: this session's most persistent defect was not in the product. It was summaries
 * drifting from the thing they summarise. MEASURED, repeatedly:
 *   - `docs/history/V1.2-PLAN.md`'s FINAL STANDINGS said "35 commits" then "54 commits" long after both were
 *     false, and was re-derived by hand each time;
 *   - the README and CHANGELOG quoted a token figure from a configuration the harness now rejects;
 *   - the CHANGELOG table and the results document quoted "nine paired trials" when there are eight
 *     arm-trials across four paired fixtures;
 *   - a benchmark step label said "agrees with 395 stored trials" after the corpus had reached 410.
 *
 * Every one was caught by hand, one at a time, by someone already suspicious. That is not a control —
 * it is luck with a process around it. This probe re-derives the counts from the repository and compares
 * them against what the documents assert, so the drift is caught by a command instead of by memory.
 *
 * It checks only things that are MECHANICALLY checkable: counts of files, commits, fixtures, configs.
 * It does not try to check prose, and it does not claim to have verified every number in every
 * document — only the ones with a single unambiguous source.
 *
 * Usage: node tooling/probes/v12-doc-consistency.mjs
 * Exit:  0 when the documents agree with the repository; 1 otherwise, naming each disagreement.
