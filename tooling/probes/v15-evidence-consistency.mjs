/**
 * v1.5 SECOND-AUDIT PASS — DOES THE PUBLIC EVIDENCE SET TELL ONE TRUTH?
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. A second auditor found the public audit set internally stale and
 * contradictory: the claim/evidence matrix still carried `83.21 % / -16.79 %` as
 * SUPPORTED while a later section of the SAME FILE withdrew it; the audit kit still asked
 * a reviewer to attack a withdrawn number; the closure document ended by declaring gates
 * NOT RUN that had since gone green; and the README still described v1.3.0 as the newest
 * published artifact. Every one of those was found by a human reading carefully — which is
 * luck with a process around it, not a control.
 *
 * WHAT THIS PROBE IS: a TRIPWIRE on the *context* of a number, not a proof of prose. It
 * cannot tell whether a sentence is true. It can tell whether a figure that this project
 * has WITHDRAWN is still being presented as current, and whether a required statement of
 * the current truth has silently disappeared.
 *
 * TWO KINDS OF CHECK, and they are deliberately different:
 *
 *  1. MARKED OCCURRENCES. A withdrawn or superseded figure may stay in the documents —
 *     deleting a published dataset is how a benchmark becomes an advertisement — but it
 *     must sit in a context that marks it. The window is the hit line plus/minus 4 lines,
 *     because a markdown table's qualifier is often the note AFTER it. That window is a
 *     heuristic and is named as one: it reduces false alarms, and it can in principle
 *     accept a stale claim that happens to sit near an unrelated "historical".
 *
 *  2. ABSENT STRINGS. Statements that are simply no longer true anywhere in these files
 *     ("NOT RUN" as a gate status, "in progress" as a finding status, "not fixed in v1.5",
 *     "v1.3.0 is the newest", "the v1.4 candidate"). No context can rescue them.
 *
 *  3. REQUIRED PINS. The current truth, in the words the documents now use. If an edit
 *     removes one of these, the edit has changed what the project claims and must be
 *     deliberate.
 *
 * FILES: the public audit set — README.md and the v1.5 documents a reviewer is pointed at.
 * FIXTURES: none (read-only). EXIT: 0 only when every check held.
