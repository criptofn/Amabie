// v1.3 §18 — IS THERE ANY TURN LEFT TO SAVE? (answered from the corpus, not from new trials)
//
// MEASURED UPDATE 3 in the audit established that trimming Amabie's own footprint cannot reach the ≤75%
// token target: the standing payload is 5,726 B/turn, about 6% of the everyday arm, so deleting all of
// it returns roughly 2 points. The remaining ~17 points would have to come from the AGENT DOING LESS
// WORK. In the recorded ledgers the dominant cost term is turns × accumulated context — cache-read is
// ~87% of the total — so "less work" means "fewer turns", and the only place Amabie adds turns is the
// completion gate: the hook refuses, the model is told why, and it runs again.
//
// That makes one question decisive, and it costs nothing to answer because every trial was already paid
// for: HOW OFTEN DOES THE GATE ACTUALLY BLOCK? If blocks are rare, there is no turn to remove, and the
// target is unreachable by any amount of engineering on the everyday path — which is worth knowing
// before spending a pilot's worth of model tokens to discover it.
//
// This probe reads the stored corpus and reports. It does not re-run anything and it invents no verdict:
// the records are the evidence, and where a field is absent the probe says so rather than assuming zero.
//
// CONFOUND, stated because the numbers below cannot separate it: a blocked run may be blocked BECAUSE it
// is a harder or longer task, so "blocked runs cost more turns" is not by itself proof that the gate
// caused the extra turns. The load-bearing number is the BLOCK RATE, which is a plain count.
