/**
 * INTEGRITY-LEVEL BOUNDARY PROBE — can this host establish a real, non-privileged worker/authority
 * separation via Windows Mandatory Integrity Control?
 *
 * THIS FILE EXISTS TO CORRECT A FALSE POSITIVE IT PREVIOUSLY REPORTED.
 *
 * The first version of this probe reported "7/7, a low-integrity process was refused write access".
 * That result was WRONG, and the bug is worth naming because it is the exact failure mode this
 * whole repository is about:
 *
 *   the CONTROL write and the CONFINED write targeted the SAME filename, so the control's own
 *   successful write satisfied the confined check. The probe measured its own control and called
 *   it a boundary.
 *
 * The fix is structural, not cosmetic: every attempt now uses a unique filename per attempt, the
 * attempt is only credited when the CHILD wrote the file (checked by content, not existence), and
 * the launcher's own exit code is never trusted — `runas` was measured to return 1 with empty
 * output for every input, including an invalid trust level, so its exit code carries no
 * information at all.
 *
 * Usage: node tooling/probes/v12-integrity-boundary.mjs
 * Exit: 0 only when a boundary is observed holding and every assertion passes;
 * 3 when no confined child can be started and the controls themselves pass
 *   (host-bound SKIP; this is not evidence that a boundary exists);
 * 1 when a control fails or an executed child does not demonstrate the boundary.
