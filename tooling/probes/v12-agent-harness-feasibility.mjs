/**
 * AGENT-HARNESS FEASIBILITY PROBE — can a measured benchmark trial actually run here?
 *
 * WHY: the v1.2 benchmark's headline numbers come from running a real coding agent under the
 * repository's own harness (`tooling/benchmark/run-trial.mjs`). That harness spawns the agent
 * CLI with `stdio: ['ignore','pipe','pipe']`, and this host refuses piped stdio (measured by
 * `tooling/probes/v12-host-capabilities.mjs`: EPERM). A benchmark that cannot start its agent
 * produces no evidence, and "we could not run it" must be reported as that — not as a result.
 *
 * This probe answers three questions with measurements, not assumptions:
 *   1. is the agent CLI present, and can it be executed at all from here?
 *   2. does the FILE-DESCRIPTOR stdio shape (the sandbox-safe one) let us capture its output?
 *   3. is there an API credential in the environment for a non-CLI path?
 *
 * It makes no model request unless the CLI answers a version query, and it spawns nothing else.
 *
 * Usage: node tooling/probes/v12-agent-harness-feasibility.mjs
 * Exit:  0 always — this is a measurement.
