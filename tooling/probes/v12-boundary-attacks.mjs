/**
 * HARDENED ATTACK BATTERY — what an untrusted, integrity-confined worker can actually do.
 *
 * THE RULE THIS BATTERY EXISTS TO ENFORCE: a security property is claimed only where an attack
 * was EXECUTED and observed to fail. So every case here runs TWICE:
 *
 *   1. a CONTROL run with NO boundary — if the attack does not succeed there, the case proves
 *      nothing (the "protection" would be an artifact of the test, not of the boundary), and the
 *      case is reported INCONCLUSIVE rather than blocked;
 *   2. the CONFINED run — the same operation, launched at a lowered integrity level.
 *
 * Only `control succeeded ∧ confined failed` counts as BLOCKED. Where the boundary genuinely does
 * not apply, the case is reported NOT ADDRESSED with the reason and excluded from the blocked
 * count rather than folded into it. Nothing in this file can turn a skip, an error or a missing
 * primitive into a pass.
 *
 * WHY EVERY RESULT TRAVELS THROUGH A FILE: `runas /trustlevel` hands the caller its own exit code,
 * not the child's (measured: it reported exit 1 with empty output for a process that really ran).
 * A pipe or an exit code would therefore read a working boundary as absent. The operation program
 * writes one word to an evidence file; the file is the evidence.
 *
 * Usage: node tooling/probes/v12-boundary-attacks.mjs [--level low|untrusted] [--json]
 * Exit: 0 only when all eight required write attacks are executed and blocked and both controls
 * pass. Missing primitives, missing evidence and inconclusive results fail closed.
