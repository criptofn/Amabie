/**
 * MEASUREMENT — can a broker in one process serve a client in ANOTHER process,
 * repeatedly?
 *
 * The provider design assumes yes: the broker is a service, the CLI is a worker,
 * and every accept/promotion is a separate CLI invocation. In-process tests cannot
 * see the difference, and while writing the provider-only routing tests this looked
 * broken (a client connected, its frame never arrived, and it timed out) — so it is
 * MEASURED here rather than assumed either way.
 *
 * THE ANSWER, and the reason this probe exits 0: a client in another process IS
 * served — but only when it does not BLOCK ITS OWN EVENT LOOP. `spawnSync` does,
 * and in this probe the broker lives in the process that would block, so those three
 * calls time out while the broker's handler records every request it eventually
 * receives. The product has no such problem (its broker is a service in its own
 * process), which is why the ASYNC path is the one that must hold, and why the
 * synchronous result is reported as an explained measurement instead of a failure.
