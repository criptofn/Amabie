/**
 * M10 mutation battery — deterministic kill checks for the obligation ladder
 * (§10) and the intent guard (§11) at the candidate boundary.
 *
 * Same convention as the m7/m8/m9 batteries: mutate the BUILT dist bytes (a
 * gitignored artifact), run the ONE probe that owns these gates (real-git M10
 * obligations+intent probe), require IT to fail with the owning scenario's
 * FAIL line, restore and byte-compare. A branch whose removal breaks nothing
 * is a branch no check actually pins. Exit 0 only when every mutation was
 * caught. NO PROOF, NO DONE.
 *
 * 22 mutations: 1–2 pin the record-write freeze (snapshot + task); 3–8 pin
 * the guard arms (drop, re-seal, kind/requirement shrink, intentEvent bytes);
 * 9–12 pin the ladder (unmet branch, unproven branch, unproven's honest
 * status, obligations riding every bundle — incl. the FAIL arm); 13–15 pin
 * the obligation ENGINE in onboarding.js (regression evidence, tests-green,
 * attributable deletion); 16–19 pin the review-round gates (lying-index fold
 * into dirty, the suffix-surviving rename escape, pre-window signal capture,
 * the clean-at-birth isolate assert); 20–22 pin the M10.2 FROZEN task-
 * AUTHORITY gate (GLM re-audit, F4-GATE-1/2): removing it re-opens the
 * taskless bypass (S12 goes PASS), reading the LIVE task instead of the
 * frozen snapshot re-opens post-isolation self-minting (S12's GATE-1 leg),
 * and re-conditioning the gate on rec.intent re-opens the legacy-PASS
 * strip-the-snapshot bypass (S5).
 * Mutation 5/7 INVERT rather than delete —
 * a guard that shouts at innocence fails the positive control, which is the
 * same evidence that the comparison is load-bearing.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT mutated — no deterministic trigger in this layer:
 *  - the promote-side double lock (startHead:null + gate 1 code!==0): either
 *    lock alone produces the identical refusal, so no probe scenario can
 *    distinguish them; the single-lock removals ARE pinned (mutation 10 makes
 *    NOT PROVEN a PASS, which gate 1 then promotes — S2 catches it). Honest
 *    redundancy, same status as M8's identity sandwich.
 *  - the seal-gone event (no seal in current config after re-create): only
 *    reachable with a hand-edited config — pinned by the M10 contract tests.
 *  - malformed-intent record refusal: loadRecord validation is a record
 *    shape property; the contract tests pin it (dist mutation of loadRecord
 *    would break every hand-written fixture record equally — no clean signal).
