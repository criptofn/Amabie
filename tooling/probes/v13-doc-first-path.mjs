// v1.3 §19 — DO THE DOCS STILL DESCRIBE THE SIMPLER PRODUCT?
//
// The v1.3 objective ends with "docs rewritten around the simpler product", and the measurement behind
// that is blunt: the everyday shape (setup once, then work normally) cost 92.7% of a plain run, while the
// candidate ceremony (`work` -> `finish`) cost 177.8% — with identical correctness. So a document that
// presents the ceremony as the ordinary way to use Amabie is not merely out of date; it steers agents
// into the shape that costs nearly twice as much.
//
// AGENTS.md is the file that matters most here, because it is the one every coding agent reads in a
// repository. It led with `amabie work` / `amabie finish` until v1.3 §19, which is exactly the text that
// produced the expensive shape. This probe pins the ORDER — the everyday path first — and pins the
// HONESTY — that where the expert path IS documented, its measured cost is stated beside it.
//
// This is a ratchet, not a style rule. It asserts two things a reader depends on: the first thing shown is
// the thing they should do, and the costlier path is never presented as free. It deliberately does NOT
// check prose, headings or wording, so the docs stay editable.
