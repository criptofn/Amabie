/**
 * v1.5 — the PUBLIC HARDENED boundary probe.
 *
 *   node tooling/probes/v15-hardened-boundary.mjs              # measure now
 *   node tooling/probes/v15-hardened-boundary.mjs --from-saved # re-print the table from the last run
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * v1.4 could say "HARDENED needs a measured boundary" but shipped no single
 * command a person OUTSIDE this project could run to see the boundary executed,
 * and the earlier evidence was written up in prose (`docs/history/V1.2-HARDENED-FINAL-BLOCKERS.md`)
 * rather than emitted by a command. This probe emits it: it EXECUTES the real
 * production boundary, then reports one row per control with the raw observation
 * the product itself validates.
 *
 * It does not re-implement the measurement. It drives the real battery
 * (`v12-production-authority.mjs`, which enrolls a disposable deployment, starts
 * the native broker, runs the confined caller and attacks it) and then reads the
 * SIGNED measurement transcript that the product wrote, so the numbers below are
 * the ones `readProductionMeasurement` accepted — not a parallel story.
 *
 * THE FOUR VERDICTS ARE DISTINCT, AND UNSUPPORTED IS NEVER A PASS
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------
 *   PASS                the control was observed holding on this host
 *   FAIL                the control was measured and did NOT hold
 *   HOST UNSUPPORTED    this host cannot execute inside the native confinement,
 *                       so nothing about the control was measured here
 *   CONTROL NOT PROVIDED Amabie does not implement the control at all (see the
 *                       non-claims section: these are never counted as passes)
 *
 * Exit code: 0 all six controls PASS; 1 a measured FAIL; 3 HOST UNSUPPORTED
 * (explicitly NOT success); 4 no measurement transcript was produced.
