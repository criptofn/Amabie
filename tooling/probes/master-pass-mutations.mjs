/**
 * master-pass-mutations — each optimization this pass introduced gets its
 * FAILURE MODE built into the shipped bytes, and the owning scenario MUST
 * catch it. Convention (repo law): mutate the built dist, owning probe/suite
 * must FAIL, restore, byte-compare, anchor-sweep. A mutation that survives
 * means the new code's failure is invisible — that is a defect in the PROOF,
 * reported loudly, not papered over.
 *
 * Mutations (one per changed mechanism):
 *   M1 stamp-reuse forced  (S4)  — re-seal would keep stale approval stamps
 *   M2 unattended refusal  (S1)  — non-TTY setup returns to writes+exit 2
 *   M3 split leak          (S3)  — every→some: an OPEN OBJECTIVE duty could be
 *                                 declared "TECHNICAL EVIDENCE: PROVEN"
 *   M4 compact strip       (S3)  — stdout stops naming the missing duties
 *   M5 status drift-blind  (S1)  — readOnlyProblems skips the sealed-authority check
 *   M6 tracked-config trust (S2) — configTracked memo poisoned to false: a git-
 *                                 committed (clonable) config reads as owned
 *   M7 env-merge escape    (B1)  — hardenedEnv merges the CALLER environment
 *                                 under the sanitized one: NODE_OPTIONS/npm_config_*
 *                                 poison reaches proof-authoritative children
 *   M8 pm trusts PATH      (B1)  — plan steps skip resolvePm; bare pm name is
 *                                 found on the caller's PATH → liar shim decides
 *   M9 git trusts PATH     (B1)  — gitExe fixed literal → bare 'git' on caller PATH
 *   M10 TTY gate removable (B3)  — accept no longer requires a terminal: a pipe
 *                                 that supplies the name self-accepts
 *   M11 stale binding gone (B3)  — freshness ignores candidateHead: acceptance
 *                                 rides onto unreviewed bytes
 *   M12 accept mints auth  (B3)  — cmdAccept's no-frozen-authority refusal gone:
 *                                 accept blesses a candidate nothing registered
 *   M13 authority duty cut (B3)  — the task-authority unshift disappears: a
 *                                 never-registered candidate PASSes (F4's root)
 *
 * NOT built as a mutation, by argument instead: the gitWithinRoot gate memo.
 * The memo caches only the toplevel-containment PRE-FILTER; every actual probe
 * still runs live and fail-closed, so no verdict observable through the CLI
 * can differ under any single-point forcing of the gate — forcing `true` makes
 * each probe run and answer from git itself; forcing `false` fails every probe
 * to null, which is the same null the live gate would produce for a real repo
 * after the toplevel vanishes mid-process. Documented in the final report
 * (item 42) rather than performed as theater.
