/**
 * DIAGNOSTIC + GATE: prove the dist-mutation guard repairs the hazard it exists
 * for, by SIMULATING the exact interruption that caused it.
 *
 * The hazard is not theoretical and is recorded in the guard's header: a killed
 * battery left `dist/src/candidate.js` holding a mutation, `tsc -b` reported the
 * project up to date, and the next battery run reported three phantom "anchor
 * drifted" failures plus a corrupt-dist sanity failure. Rebuilding gave 15/15.
 *
 * This probe reproduces that shape on a COPY of a real dist file — it never
 * mutates the live tree — and asserts:
 *   1. a fresh `beginDistMutation` recovers a journal left by an "interrupted"
 *      run, restoring bytes exactly;
 *   2. the journal is what makes the staleness DISCOVERABLE (`isMutationInFlight`);
 *   3. an unrecoverable journal (sidecar missing) is reported honestly and told
 *      to rebuild, instead of silently trusting the tree;
 *   4. `endDistMutation` restores and clears.
 *
 * It also checks the live tree is not currently mid-mutation, which is the fact a
 * caller must know before reading dist.
