/**
 * In-place `dist` mutation is a real hazard, and this was MEASURED, not imagined.
 *
 * The mutation batteries (`m7`/`m8`/`m9`/`m10`, `master-pass`) work by editing the
 * BUILT `apps/cli/dist/**` bytes, running the owning probe, and restoring. That
 * is legitimate — dist is a gitignored artifact. The failure mode is not:
 *
 *   1. a battery is KILLED mid-mutation (a timeout, a CI cancel, a closed
 *      terminal). `finally` never runs, so `dist` keeps a MUTATED file;
 *   2. the mutated file has a fresh mtime and `.tsbuildinfo` already records the
 *      source as compiled, so **`tsc -b` considers the project up to date and
 *      does NOT repair it** — a subsequent `npm test` or probe then judges
 *      mutated product code and reports a defect that does not exist.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical: it happened in this repository. A killed
 * `m9-mutation-battery` left `candidate.js` holding mutation #4 (the authority
 * list minus `recordPath(root, name)`), and the NEXT battery run reported
 * `12/15 mutations caught` with three "anchor drifted: occurs 0x" lines and a
 * failing post-battery sanity check — all of it an artifact of the stale bytes.
 * Rebuilding correctly gave 15/15.
 *
 * WHAT THIS GUARD DOES ABOUT IT: it makes an in-flight mutation DISCOVERABLE and
 * RECOVERABLE rather than silent.
 *   - `beginDistMutation(files)` first RECOVERS any mutation a previous run left
 *     behind (from a byte-identical sidecar copy), then writes a journal naming
 *     every file it is about to touch.
 *   - `endDistMutation()` verifies the files are back and clears the journal.
 *   - `recoverInterruptedMutation()` can be called by anything that reads dist
 *     (the productization oracle does) so a stale tree is repaired before it is
 *     trusted.
 * A journal without a live owning process means "dist is not trustworthy" — the
 * one fact that was previously invisible.
