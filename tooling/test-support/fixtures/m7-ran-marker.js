// M7 probe fixture: the drift-BLOCKS-BEFORE-EXECUTION check swaps a candidate's
// sealed test script to run THIS file. If it executes, it leaves a marker — the
// marker's absence is mechanical proof the block preceded any run, not a
// behavioral claim. Marker path arrives as argv (probe-scoped); the fallback
// keeps direct/manual runs working. Exits 0 on purpose: a swapped-to-green
// hollow check is exactly the attack the seal must stop.
