// M10 probe fixture (S10) — a sealed plan step that WRITES a test file into
// the working tree it runs in, then exits green. This is the laundering
// shape: the step mints its own regression evidence mid-window.
//
// Deliberate confinement: it only writes when its CWD is a candidate
// worktree (the immediate parent directory is named 'candidates' —
// <root>/.amabie/candidates/<name>). During setup's smoke the same step
// runs in the base repo root and must leave no residue, so the base stays
// clean and the scenario's premise ("every deletion in the candidate is
// the candidate's") holds untouched.
//
// The FIX this fixture pins: obligation signals are collected BEFORE the
// execution window, so this write can never count as evidence for the
// verdict whose run performed it.
