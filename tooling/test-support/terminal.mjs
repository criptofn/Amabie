/**
 * Terminal provider for the human-acceptance act — one source of truth for
 * `pre10-acceptance.mjs` and `f3-acceptance-growth.mjs`.
 *
 * `amabie accept` refuses unless BOTH `process.stdin.isTTY` and
 * `process.stdout.isTTY` are true (apps/cli/src/candidate.ts). The strongest
 * way to exercise that is a REAL pty, which on POSIX means util-linux
 * `script -qec`. Windows has no `script(1)`, so the probes used to fail there
 * with `status: null` — and a `null` status is a host limitation wearing the
 * costume of a product failure.
 *
 * Measured on this host (`tooling/probes/tty-capability.mjs` prints the
 * evidence): `winpty.exe` from Git for Windows exists but refuses to run
 * without a console of its own ("stdin is not a tty"), and with
 * `-Xallow-non-tty` it aborts on its own assertion
 * (`cols > 0 && rows > 0`) because a console-less parent has no size to hand
 * it; `script` is absent; WSL has `script` but no `node` inside the distro.
 * So there is NO drivable real pty here.
 *
 * What this module does about that — and what it deliberately refuses to do:
 *
 *   - If a real pty program IS resolvable, use it. Every acceptance assertion
 *     then runs at full strength and `provenRealPty` is true.
 *   - Otherwise, do NOT skip the product behaviour on the floor. Drive the SAME
 *     exported command through the repo's in-process terminal driver
 *     (`accept-review-driver.mjs`, the mechanism `architecture-closure.mjs`
 *     already uses on Windows), so every product assertion still executes and a
 *     real regression still fails the probe.
 *   - Report `provenRealPty: false` so the caller prints an EXPLICIT
 *     host-bound SKIP and exits 3: the OS-level pty allocation is NOT proven
 *     here, and a SKIP is never allowed to read as a PASS.
