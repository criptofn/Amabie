# v0.1 audit remediation Ledger — 2026-08-30

Authority for this work: the independent Codex audit finding list (relayed by the
operator 2026-08-30). Each finding below was located in code at baseline
(`4106b41`, branch `audit-hardening`, 73/73 tests passing, build clean) — i.e.
**every listed finding was confirmed to have a live mechanism in the code, not
merely suspected**.

Operating rules (from operator):
- Provider-blocked items are marked `PROVIDER_BLOCKED`, never retried with the
  same generated content, never papered over by weakening Amabie.
- After each milestone: focused tests → full suite → build+typecheck → golden
  Axios proof rerun (when the production pipeline is affected) → ledger update →
  local commit. No pushes, no remote, no v0.2 scope.
- Findings are treated as confirmed until independently disproven with
  **execution evidence**.

## Baseline facts

| item | value |
|---|---|
| branch | `audit-hardening` @ `4106b41` |
| tests at start | 73/73 pass, build+typecheck clean |
| golden proof | `npm run prove` — axios 0.27.2→1.0.0 on `ctimmerm/axios-mock-adapter@b8804442` |

## Milestones and findings

Status legend: OPEN · DONE · PROVIDER_BLOCKED · DISPROVEN(with evidence)

### M1 — regression-classification correctness
| ID | Finding | Root cause located | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | False CONFIRMED_REGRESSION when candidate prints a passing summary then exits nonzero | `executor.round()` sets `reportedFailing = parseSummaryCounts(...).failing` — mocha/ava omit the "N failing" line when zero fail → `undefined`, and `isInfraRound`'s guard needs `=== 0`. Guard exists but is unreachable for real runner output. | DONE (c8be6aa: matched-summary-without-count ⇒ reported-zero; conservative INFRASTRUCTURE_FAILURE) |
| F2 | Differing candidate failure counts/identities still treated as deterministic | `classify()` compares only exit-code parity (`unanimous`/`every(pass)`); identical exit 3 with 2-vs-5 failing tests or different failing test identities still yields CONFIRMED_REGRESSION. | DONE (c8be6aa: rule 8 — within-arm failure-profile equality (count + sorted identities); divergence ⇒ FLAKY) |

### M2 — evidence semantic integrity
| ID | Finding | Root cause located | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| F3 | Evidence validator accepts contradictory fabricated evidence | `validateBundle` is purely structural: any hand-authored bundle with well-shaped fields passes (label need not follow from rounds; `reproductionCount` unchecked vs candidate rounds; timeout/exit contradictions unchecked; unconfined drift + CONFIRMED label accepted). Fix: persist `infraSignal`/`reportedFailing`/`failingTestNames` per round (M1) and **re-derive** the classification inside the validator. | DONE (c8be6aa: validator re-derives classification, enforces reproductionCount, timeout/exit consistency, drift confinement vs trustful verdicts, sparsity refusal) |

### M3 — proof verification against real artifacts
| ID | Finding | Root cause located | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| F4 | Proof accepts tampered hashes because it does not fully rehash artifacts | `cmdProve`/`assertProof` compare bundle fields to expectations but never re-hash the on-disk `.stdout.log`/`.norm` files against the recorded `raw*/normalized*Sha256`. Tampering artifacts (and log-derived assertions) is invisible. | DONE (M3: `verifyArtifacts` re-hashes all 4 files/round inside `cmdProve` — covers both `prove` and `check` — before any assertion; runs on the post-rerun dir, not just the pointer. Execution evidence: golden proof 16/16 PASS + live tamper test — appended byte to `baseline-1.stdout.log` → `check` exit 3 naming `TAMPERED artifact baseline-1.stdout.log` with both digests; restored → exit 0) |

### M4 — process lifecycle containment
| ID | Finding | Root cause located | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| F5 | Detached descendants can survive a normal successful execution | `killTree` runs only on timeout. On normal `close`, descendants (same group on POSIX, children on Windows) are never swept. | DONE (M4, this host) — post-close `sweepDescendants()` on EVERY exit (Windows: live-orphan PPID lineage via CIM + CreationDate floor vs PID-reuse; POSIX: /proc pgrp scan + group-kill backstop). Residual, documented in code: POSIX `setsid()` double-fork daemon escapes both sweep and (here) proof-of-absence — v0.1 claims best-effort containment sweep, NOT a kernel jail. **POSIX branch not yet executed** (no WSL on this host; no push so ubuntu CI not run tonight) — mechanism-proven test + containment e2e both green on Windows. |

### M5 — environment consistency
| ID | Finding | Root cause located | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| F6 | Child environment exposes undeclared Windows variables incl. HOMEDRIVE/HOMEPATH | `sanitizedEnv` returns a literal allowlist block, but `envKeys` in evidence records **declared** keys, never the child's **observed** keys. Vector unverified — M5 starts with an executed child-env observation probe; fix or DISPROVEN per result, then keep observation as a permanent assertion test. | DONE (M5, this host) — executed probe CONFIRMED the vector and found it worse than reported: real `HOMEPATH=\Users\…`, `USERNAME`, `USERDOMAIN`, `LOGONSERVER`, `HOMEDRIVE`, `SYSTEMDRIVE` appear even for `env:{}` — the WINDOWS LOADER appends session vars regardless of block replacement (so "allowlist ⇒ invisible" was false). Fix: sanitizedEnv NEUTRALIZES all six with fixed non-identity values (explicit vars win over loader injection — probe-verified); `SANITIZE_ALLOWLIST` extended to cover the full cross-platform declaration (15 win32 keys); PERMANENT observation test (`packages/support/test/env.test.ts`) asserts child-observed keys == declared and identity vars hold neutral values. Bundle `envKeys` is now truthful by verification. POSIX equality awaits ubuntu CI. |

### M6 — package-manager/config handling
| ID | Finding | Root cause located | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| F7 | Uppercase `.NPMRC` bypasses config audit on Windows | `findRcFiles` compares `e.name` case-sensitively against `RISKY_RC_FILES`; on case-insensitive filesystems `.NPMRC` is loaded by npm as project config. | DONE (M6: case-INSENSITIVE match everywhere — fail-closed even on Linux; 2 new audit tests incl. mixed-case nested `.YarnRc.yml`) |
| F8 | npm global options before the install subcommand bypass `--ignore-scripts` injection | `expandArgv` finds the subcommand as the first token not starting with `-` — a **value-taking** option (`$npm -u evil.npmrc install x`) shifts detection to `evil.npmrc`, silently skipping ALL isolation flags. Also no rejection of spec-provided conflicting config flags. | DONE (M6: `pmArgvGuard` — short options rejected outright; isolation-conflicting long flags rejected BEFORE and AFTER subcommand (`--userconfig/--prefix/--registry/--cache/--script-shell/...`); unknown bare option before subcommand rejected instead of guessed; `exec/x/dlx/shell/explore` subcommands forbidden (trailing injection dead after `--`). 5 new tests; golden argv shapes all still expand + inject) |

### M7 — tree-drift correctness
| ID | Finding | Root cause located | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| F9 | Confinement removal not caught by the 73-test suite | The rule-9 confinement override lives inline in `runExperiment`; no test exercises it. Fix: pure `applyConfinementGuard` + offline end-to-end pipeline test (M8 seam) so guard removal flips a test. | DONE (M7, unit half): pure `applyConfinementGuard()` exported from classification; pipeline rewired to it; 5 new unit tests (downgrades CONFIRMED/PASS/PRE_EXISTING; never masks INFRA; identity when confined; guard-removal-flip property). The offline e2e half of the fix lands with M8's pipeline test. |
| F10 | Scoped/nested dependency drift handling gaps | `diffTrees` passes the **raw** spec package name into `inDependencySubtree` while tree keys are `escapePkgKey`-encoded — for a scoped dep (`@scope/pkg` → key `@scope%2Fpkg`) `key === dependency` never matches → every scoped-drift report is falsely "not confined". `endsWith('/'+dep)` also needs the escaped form. | DONE (M7: inDependencySubtree escapes the dependency argument (idempotent); 3 new comparator tests — scoped own-subtree confined, lookalikes still rejected, scoped+external-drift still NOT confined) |

### M8 — pipeline and CLI integration tests
| ID | Finding | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| F13 | Failing-test identities not persisted in the Evidence Bundle | No `failingTestNames` in `RoundEvidence`/schema. Fix lands with M1 (classification consumes identities), persisted here. | DONE (c8be6aa: `infraSignal`/`reportedFailing`/`failingTestNames` flow executor → bundle → published JSON schema) |
| — | (gap) No `apps/cli` tests exist at all; `npm test` glob doesn't cover `apps/**` | Fix: offline e2e experiment (local stub fixture, no network) exercising pipeline → classification → evidence → prove/check, including confinement guard, fabricated-tamper rejection, CLI exit codes. | DONE (M8, this commit): `apps/**` in test+CI globs (M3), `prove.test.ts` (M3), `pipeline-e2e.test.ts` (4 offline REAL-pipeline e2e runs: confirm/rehash, rule-9 flip, tamper, fabricated-refusal) and `cli.test.ts` (built CLI subprocess: check 0/3, report 3/0, version 0, usage 3). |

### M9 — CLI/report consistency
| ID | Finding | Root cause located | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| F12 | `npm run report` unusable without explicit evidence argument | `cmdReport` requires argv[1]; root script passes none → usage/exit 3. Fix: default to latest run's evidence; report must render failing-test identities from the bundle itself (currently only via unused `extras`). | DONE (M9): `findLatestEvidencePath()` resolves the newest `.amabie-runs/latest-*.json` by mtime; `report` with no arg uses it (verified live: `npm run report` → exit 0). `renderHtml` now derives failing identities from the bundle's candidate rounds (F13) with `extras` demoted to an optional override; real axios report renders "handles baseURL correctly"/"can pass headers to match to a handler" with no caller passing extras. 3 new tests + live proof. |

### M10 — CI running the real proof
| ID | Finding | Root cause located | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| F11 | CI runs `amabie run` instead of real proof assertions | `ci.yml` golden-proof step only checks `run`'s exit code. Fix: `run` + `check` in CI; split proof expectations into portable assertions (classification/rule/exit codes/summaries/failing identities/internal determinism) vs machine-local hash assertions skipped off-proof-host (structured `hostFingerprint` comparison, not string vibes). | DONE (M10): `assertProof` now takes an optional structured `proofHost {platform,arch,nodeVersion,npmVersion}`; only the two cross-host normalized-hash comparisons are gated (SKIP reported explicitly in the assertion list, never silent) — the other 14 assertions incl. within-arm determinism evaluate on EVERY host. Golden proof.json carries proofHost=win32/x64/v26.3.0/11.16.0; `ci.yml` now runs `amabie run` AND `amabie check` (job fails on any portable divergence). 4 assertProof gating tests. |

### M11 — documentation truth pass
| ID | Finding | Root cause located | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| F14 | No filesystem sandbox or network allowlist exists; docs must not claim it | README/SECURITY claims checked against code: env allowlist + audit gate + no-shell + pinned SHA are real; fs jail / network egress control are not. Rewrite claims to enforced-guarantee vs best-effort vs absent, and record M4/M5/M6 outcomes honestly (incl. residual gaps like post-exit orphan spawn). | DONE (M11): SECURITY.md restructured into Tier A (code-enforced: no-shell, env observed==declared, audit gate, undodgeable injection, SHA pinning, deterministic classification + rule-9, tree-kill + exit-sweep), Tier B (convention: disposable workspace, sweep residual for setsid daemons), Tier C (ABSENT: network egress allowlist, fs jail — stated verbatim, "do not claim these"). README lead + security section retitled and honest about limits; PLAN §9.1 items 3/5/6/9 corrected (neutralized vars; not-a-jail; not-a-firewall; sanitizer lives in support); stale `--portable` plan replaced by what F11 actually shipped; fixture README era-install step corrected to what the spec really runs; red-team F-numbers disambiguated (RT-F#) from audit F1–F15. |
| F15 | Linux/cross-platform support not proven | CI core job is ubuntu but golden proof is windows-only and never runs on Linux. Fix scope for v0.1: honestly document platform status; add ubuntu CI leg for the offline suite (already ubuntu); do NOT claim the golden proof is Linux-proven without an executed Linux run. | DONE (M11, within v0.1 scope): SECURITY.md gains a "Platform status" section: Windows = fully executed (133 tests incl. real-subprocess + golden proof host); Linux = written-for but NOT executed (POSIX sweep/env/tar paths await ubuntu CI on push; golden proof stays windows-only). Also fixed a REAL Windows-only bug found during the pass: production extraction hard-coded `System32\tar.exe` — now platform-branched (still UNVERIFIED on Linux until CI runs; the offline suite injects extract and does not exercise it). |

## Deferred / out of scope (v0.1)

No v0.2 features. No RepoWise/Semgrep/CodSpeed/Playwright/cloud/distributed/AI-diagnosis.
`packages/registry-npm` stays reserved.

## Milestone log

(append one dated entry per milestone: what changed, test results, commit hash)

### 2026-08-30 — M1 + M2 (F1, F2, F13, F3) @ c8be6aa
Classification fixes (F1 zero-failing-line ⇒ reported-zero; F2 rule-8 within-arm
failure-profile equality), per-round identity plumbing (F13), and the semantic
`validateBundle` re-derivation (F3). Suite 73→89 green; build+typecheck clean;
golden Axios proof PASS (16/16, identical normalized hashes) post-M1. Honest
note: M1+M2 landed as one commit and the ledger status cells were not flipped
at commit time — corrected here at M3. The post-M2 golden-proof rerun was
folded into the M3 rerun below (M2 changed only validation, which the prove
path exercises before assertions — so the M3 PASS covers it).

### 2026-08-30 — M3 (F4) @ 9364538
`verifyArtifacts()` re-hashes all four per-round artifacts against recorded
digests; `cmdProve` (both `prove` and `check`) refuses on any mismatch before
assertions, and re-checks the post-rerun dir. New `apps/cli/test/prove.test.ts`
(6 tests: clean, raw-tamper, norm-tamper, missing, all-four, logPath-contract);
test+CI globs now cover `apps/**` (first slice of the M8 gap). Suite 89→95
green; build+typecheck clean; golden Axios proof PASS (16/16). Live negative
test on real proof artifacts: byte-append to `baseline-1.stdout.log` →
`check` exit 3, `TAMPERED artifact baseline-1.stdout.log` (recorded vs on-disk
digests printed); restore → `check` exit 0.

### 2026-08-30 — M4 (F5) @ this commit
`runCommand` now sweeps descendants after EVERY child close (normal exit and
timeout alike): `sweepDescendants()` — win32 BFS over `Win32_Process.ParentProcessId`
(live orphans retain their creator's PPID) with a CreationDate≥spawn−60s floor
against PID-reuse collateral, POSIX /proc `pgrp==childPid` scan (ps fallback)
plus negative-pgid SIGKILL backstop. `RunOutcome` gains `childPid`/`sweptPids`/
`sweepFailed`. 5 new tests in `packages/support/test/lifecycle.test.ts`
(mechanism proof against a LIVE parent + containment e2e normal-exit/timeout/
no-descendants/no-self-kill). Execution note: the dev session runs inside a
Windows Job Object that kills orphans on parent exit — the e2e survivor could
not be left alive for the sweep here, so the sweep mechanism is proven
directly against a live parent (found + killed the child) while e2e asserts
containment regardless of winning layer; that environment fact does NOT hold
for production runs generally. Suite 95→100; build+typecheck clean; golden
Axios proof PASS (16/16). POSIX branch awaits ubuntu execution (CI leg — no
push tonight); F15 documents the same.

### 2026-08-31 — M5 (F6) @ 5702019
Executed child-env observation probe FIRST, as the ledger required. Vector
CONFIRMED and worse than stated: Windows appends the logon session's identity
vars to every child environment even when the block is fully replaced
(`env:{}` still yielded the real `USERNAME`/`HOMEPATH`/`LOGONSERVER`/
`USERDOMAIN`/`HOMEDRIVE`/`SYSTEMDRIVE`), while evidence recorded only the
declared 9. A second probe proved explicitly-declared vars win over loader
injection, so `sanitizedEnv` now neutralizes all six with fixed non-identity
values (USERNAME=amabie, USERDOMAIN=AMABIE, LOGONSERVER=\\\\AMABIE, HOME-
drive/path/SYSTEMDRIVE derived from the disposable workspace). SANITIZE_-
ALLOWLIST (evidence schema) extended accordingly. New PERMANENT observation
test `packages/support/test/env.test.ts` (3 tests): observed keys == declared
keys (incl. what the bundle records), neutralized values proven in the child,
no credential/behavior-injection vars visible, real account identity absent.
Executor test de-duplicated its hard-coded key list to derive from
sanitizedEnv. Suite 100→103; build+typecheck clean; golden Axios proof PASS
(16/16 — npm output unaffected by the neutralized vars). POSIX observed==
declared awaits ubuntu CI (no WSL here; F15).

### 2026-08-31 — M6 (F7, F8) @ this commit
F7: `findRcFiles` now matches rc names case-INSENSITIVELY (`RISKY_RC_FILES_-
LOWER`), so `.NPMRC` / `.YarnRc.yml` trip the injection gate on Windows/macOS
case-insensitive filesystems — fail-closed on Linux too. 2 new audit tests
(uppercase root `.NPMRC`, mixed-case nested `.YarnRc.yml`).
F8: `pmArgvGuard()` replaces the shift-able `find(!startsWith('-'))` detector.
It throws AmabieError on: any short option (`-u` etc.), any isolation-
conflicting long flag (`--userconfig/--prefix/--cache/--registry/--global/
--script-shell/--workspace/--omit/...`) in EITHER position (before or after
the subcommand — npm honors both), an unknown bare option before the
subcommand (cannot be proven valueless ⇒ could shift detection), and the
`exec/x/dlx/shell/explore` subcommands (fetch+run third-party code where the
trailing injection would land after `--` and evaporate). Legitimate self-
describing (`--key=value`) and known-boolean options pass; injection is
unchanged when the subcommand is install-family. 5 new executor tests incl.
the exact `$npm -u evil.npmrc install x` bypass (now rejected) and a
regression guard that `--loglevel=silent install` still injects. Suite
103→110; build+typecheck clean; golden Axios proof PASS (16/16 — the real
`--before=…`/`--no-save`/`--no-package-lock`/`--frozen-lockfile` shapes all
expand and inject correctly).

### 2026-08-31 — M7 (F9, F10) @ this commit
F10: `inDependencySubtree` now `escapePkgKey`s the dependency argument before
matching (keys are escaped by treeHash; comparing raw '@scope/pkg' against
'@scope%2Fpkg' never matched, so a scoped dependency's OWN subtree was always
falsely "not confined" → permanent false INCONCLUSIVE). Escaping is
idempotent, tolerates already-escaped callers, and keeps the red-team F4
lookalike protections intact. 3 comparator tests.
F9: rule-9 confinement override extracted from inline pipeline code into
pure `applyConfinementGuard()` in @canary-rn/classification (pipeline rewired
— behavior byte-identical). 5 classification tests pin: downgrade of every
trustful label under unconfined drift, INFRA never masked, identity under
confined drift, and the guard-removal-flip property. The offline e2e
pipeline test for the same seam is the M8 gap and lands next.
Suite 110→118; build+typecheck clean; golden Axios proof PASS (16/16).

### 2026-08-31 — M8 (gap) @ this commit
First-ever apps/cli integration tests beyond prove.test.ts. `runExperiment`
gains an optional `deps` seam ({fetch, extract}, same idiom as the existing
ExecutorDeps.run / downloadTarball.fetchFn) — production default path
byte-identical (real downloadTarball + tar.exe). New
`apps/cli/test/pipeline-e2e.test.ts`: 4 OFFLINE end-to-end runs of the REAL
pipeline (local stub repo; every step a local `node` script; npm ls offline
against the stub's node_modules; real artifacts on disk):
 1. confined widget 1→2 regression → CONFIRMED_REGRESSION rule 5, bundle
    self-validates, verifyArtifacts clean, candidate persists
    failingTestNames+reportedFailing (F13 e2e), faithful proof passes;
 2. swap that also bumps an unrelated dep → drift NOT confined → INCONCLUSIVE
    rule 9 with the offending package in the reason (F9 e2e — guard removal
    now flips a suite test);
 3. byte-append to a real candidate artifact → verifyArtifacts names the
    TAMPERED file (F4 e2e);
 4. real confirmed bundle re-labeled PASS rule 3 → validateBundle refuses via
    re-derivation (F3 e2e).
Plus `apps/cli/test/cli.test.ts`: the BUILT CLI spawned as a subprocess
against an offline-staged repo — check exit 0 (proof PASS) / exit 3 with the
TAMPERED artifact named, report exit 3 on a fabricated bundle + exit 0
rendering a valid one, version 0, no-args usage 3 (the documented exit-code
contract). Suite 118→126; typecheck clean; golden Axios proof PASS (16/16 —
production default path verified unchanged by the seam).

### 2026-08-31 — M9 (F12) @ this commit
`npm run report` (the literally-unusable command) now works: `cmdReport`
defaults to `findLatestEvidencePath()` — newest `.amabie-runs/latest-*.json`
by mtime, skipping stale/unreadable pointers — with an explicit
evidence.json still honored; usage text documents the optionality.
`renderHtml` derives failing-test identities from the bundle's own candidate
rounds (F13 persistence); `extras` demoted to explicit-override-only. Live
verification on THIS repo's real state: `npm run report` → exit 0 and the
generated report.html for the Axios golden run contains
"handles baseURL correctly" and "can pass headers to match" — no caller ever
passed extras; that HTML is the artifact-level F12+F13 proof. New tests:
report-suite bundle-derivation + section-omission, CLI subprocess no-arg
report e2e. Suite 126→129; typecheck clean; golden Axios proof PASS (16/16).

### 2026-08-31 — M10 (F11) @ this commit
CI now runs the REAL proof, not just `amabie run`'s exit code. `assertProof`
gains a structured `proofHost` fingerprint {platform,arch,nodeVersion,
npmVersion}: the two cross-host normalized-stdout-hash comparisons evaluate
only when the evidence environment matches it field-for-field, and otherwise
report as explicit `… [SKIPPED: not proof host …]` assertions (ok=true,
skipped=true) rather than failing. All 14 portable assertions —
classification, rule, drift-confined, resolved-version attestation, dependency
+ commit pinning, per-arm exit codes, WITHIN-ARM determinism (host-independent),
numeric summaries, extracted failing-test identities — are asserted on every
host, so `amabie check` in CI fails the job on any real regression-of-truth.
Golden proof.json carries proofHost win32/x64/v26.3.0/11.16.0; ci.yml
golden-proof job runs `amabie run` then `amabie check`. main.ts prints a
`skip` tag and an honest PASS line ("N assertions held (M host-exact
skipped)"). 4 assertProof gating tests. Suite 129→133; build+typecheck clean;
golden Axios proof PASS on THIS host with all 16 (host matches, "all, incl.
host-exact hashes"). CI's own ubuntu/windows legs run on push (not tonight).

### 2026-08-31 — M11 (F14, F15) @ this commit
Documentation truth pass. SECURITY.md: new lead-in warning; environment
section rewritten around the EXECUTED F6 finding (loader appends; six vars
neutralized; observed==declared by permanent test); "Filesystem and network
boundaries" replaced by an explicit Tier A (code-enforced) / Tier B
(convention; setsid-escape + PID-reuse residuals named) / Tier C (ABSENT: no
fs jail, no network allowlist — "do not claim these") breakdown; red-team
findings renumbered RT-F# to end the F-number collision with the audit; new
section summarizing F1–F15 outcomes with ledger pointer; new "Platform status"
section (F15): Windows executed / Linux written-for-not-executed, golden
proof windows-host-designated. README: lead + security heading honest about
enforcement scope, "what v0.1 does NOT claim" block, report[] usage, test
count 73→133. PLAN.md §9.1: items 3/5/6/9 corrected (neutralizations; "no
writes" and "network limited" explicitly labeled unenforced convention/
intent; sanitizer located in packages/support); §10 limits updated — stale
`--portable` plan replaced by the shipped proofHost design; M5 milestone row
closed with pointer to this ledger. fixture README: era-install step now
describes what the spec actually runs (`--before` date pin, not
--frozen-lockfile). Code found by the pass: production tar extraction
hard-coded `System32\tar.exe` (Linux could never run `amabie run`) —
platform-branched, honestly marked UNVERIFIED-on-Linux.
Suite 133/133; typecheck clean; golden Axios proof PASS (16/16 all
host-exact). ALL 15 audit findings now processed: none PROVIDER_BLOCKED;
the only open honest gap is Linux execution of POSIX paths, deferred to CI
by the no-push constraint (documented, not hidden).

### 2026-08-31 — red-team follow-up (F8 case-fold) @ 7158676
Second adversarial pass over the new gates. Found and fixed: the F8
conflict/bare-ok sets were matched case-SENSITIVELY, so `--Userconfig=…`
relied on npm's parser being case-sensitive to be caught. Option names are
now case-folded before every membership test (regression test with 3 case
variants). Re-examined and confirmed sound: the `--` break (post-`--` tokens
are positional to npm, not config), short-option rejection, `exec/dlx/shell`
forbiddance, and the sweep's PID-reuse floor + setsid residual (documented
Tier B, not a claim of kernel containment). Suite 133→134.

### 2026-08-31 — CLEAN-ROOM VALIDATION (from Git) @ 7158676
Fresh local clone (`git clone file://`), empty tree at HEAD, no shared state
with the working directory:
- `npm install` (17 pkgs) → `npm run build` → `npm run typecheck`: clean.
- `node --test packages/** apps/**`: **134/134 pass** (26 suites) in the clone.
- `npm run prove` (live network, real axios 0.27.2→1.0.0, fresh fetch→era
  install→baseline×2→swap→candidate×3): **PASS — 16/16 assertions, incl.
  host-exact normalized-hash equality** — the golden proof reproduces byte-for-
  byte from a pristine checkout, not just the dev tree.
Verified cwd before AND after (a first attempt had silently reverted to the
main tree; re-run confirmed genuine clean-room execution).

## Final status: READY FOR INDEPENDENT RE-AUDIT

All 15 Codex-audit findings + the apps/cli test gap are DONE. Zero
PROVIDER_BLOCKED, zero DISPROVEN-without-evidence (F6 was probed and
CONFIRMED before fixing). The one honest, non-blocking residual is that
POSIX-side code (env observation equality, process sweep, tar extraction) is
WRITTEN AND TESTED-BY-CONSTRUCTION but has NOT been executed on Linux this
session (no Linux host; CI legs run on push) — documented in SECURITY.md
"Platform status", not hidden. This is a v0.1 verification core, not
"Amabie complete": no v0.2 features, no integrations, per operating rules.
