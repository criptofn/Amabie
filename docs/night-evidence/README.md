# Night Runner evidence — retention contract

**Rule: a report's evidence paths must resolve inside the repository.**
`NO PROOF, NO DONE` applies to the evidence *layer* too: an unattended run
whose RED/GREEN/mutant/probe logs exist only in an ephemeral directory is not
auditable, and a green `git status` around missing evidence is not "clean".

The independent 2026-09-05 audit of the F6 night run proved this by
mechanical failure: the report cited `.night-run/*.log`, but `.night-run/`
is per-worktree scratch, never tracked by git, and its ignore lived only in
the builder's local `.git/info/exclude`. Another worktree or a fresh clone
of the same commit contained **none** of the cited evidence.

## Convention

1. `.night-run/` is scratch (git-ignored, not shared between worktrees).
   Writes there during a run are fine.
2. **Before recording DONE**, every evidence file a report cites must be
   copied into `docs/night-evidence/<UTC-date>-<slug>/` (this directory) and
   the report must cite the `docs/` path, not the `.night-run/` path.
   `cp .night-run/<f> docs/night-evidence/<slug>/<f>` — no tooling needed.
3. The evidence commit and the report commit must be the same or adjacent;
   a report citing `docs/night-evidence/...` paths that are not in
   `git ls-files` is not done.
4. Re-derivations and corrections (post-audit) go in the same directory,
   prefixed so the original attempt-1 logs stay byte-identical.

## Contents

- `2026-09-05-F6/` — night-run F6 attempt-1 (starting SHA `34cf515`,
  five fixes, final HEAD `d327e71`), exported post-audit plus re-derivation
  logs. Index: `2026-09-05-F6/DONE` and
  `docs/history/NIGHT-F6-HARDENING-2026-09-05.md` (errata section records what was
  wrong in attempt 1).
- `2026-09-06-productization/` — productization workbench night
  (commit `2b72cc4`): clean-room runs (including the lazy-vibecoder
  post-fix log), full-suite before/after logs, and the HTG inline-classifier
  pre-fix/post-fix evidence. No prose report accompanies it; the logs speak
  for themselves.
- `2026-09-09-m10-1-hardening/` — M10.1 hardening (F4 taskless-obligation
  bypass closure + R1–R5): before-fix `F4-BYPASS: OPEN` repro (attempt-1 and
  attempt-2 logs kept byte-identical next to the authoritative OPEN run),
  after-fix CLOSED repro, baseline/intermediate/final suite logs, the M7–M10
  mutation batteries, per-probe finals, dist sha byte-stability notes, and the
  `verify:productization` chain log. Report:
  `docs/history/NIGHT-M10.1-HARDENING-2026-09-09.md`.
