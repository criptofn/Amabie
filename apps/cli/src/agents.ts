/**
 * 1.1 §18–21 — agent integration behind ONE provider-neutral contract.
 *
 * Amabie's verification core must not depend on Claude-specific hooks, and it
 * must not PRETEND about an agent it cannot gate. This file is the honest
 * capability table:
 *
 *   - `gating: true`  — this integration can BLOCK a completion (a hook the
 *                       harness actually honours). Claude Code and OpenAI Codex
 *                       CLI qualify today, and both run the SAME `checkpoint`
 *                       entry point: one verification implementation, two pieces
 *                       of wiring, no fork.
 *   - `gating: false` — the integration is REAL but ADVISORY: it tells the
 *                       agent to consult Amabie and gives it a compact,
 *                       machine-readable answer, but nothing can block a
 *                       completion the harness does not gate. Reported as
 *                       advisory, never as protection.
 *   - `available: false` — detected but not integrable at all.
 *
 * Every agent that can run a command already has the strongest portable
 * integration Amabie can offer (`amabie result --json` / `amabie doctor
 * --json`); this table exists so nobody has to guess which of them can also be
 * *enforced*.
 *
 * The advisory integration writes a marked block into the project's AGENTS.md.
 * It is only ever installed by an explicit command, it is idempotent, it is
 * removable by one command, and it is containment-checked like every other file
 * Amabie writes.

     * The old summary read "ADVISORY only — no completion hook exists to gate". MEASURED on this host
     * (2026-09-20): `codex --version` → `codex-cli 0.154.0`, `codex features list` → `hooks  stable
     * true`, `--help` exposes `--dangerously-bypass-hook-trust`, and the vendor's hook reference
     * documents a `Stop` event whose contract is the SAME one `cmdCheckpoint` already implements for
     * Claude Code: one JSON object on stdin (`cwd`, `stop_hook_active`), JSON on stdout,
     * `{"decision":"block","reason"}` to CONTINUE the turn with that reason as the next prompt, and
     * exit 0 with no output to let it stop. `amabie setup` therefore writes a `Stop` handler into
     * `.codex/hooks.json` — the SAME command, from the SAME `buildHookCommand` — and the run that
     * gates is the same `amabie checkpoint`, so the hook gains no authority it did not have.
     *
     * `gatingMeasured: true` is a claim about EVIDENCE, and the evidence is
     * `tooling/probes/v14-codex-stop-hook.mjs`: the hook driven exactly as Codex documents it
     * (stdin event → stdout decision, pass → silent allow, fail → parsed `decision: "block"`), plus a
     * real `codex exec` session in a temp repository in which Codex executed this hook and continued
     * the turn on its reason. If that run is not reproducible on a host — and the probe says so with
     * an explicit SKIP rather than a pass — the honest reading stays "the adapter is written; gating
     * is UNMEASURED there", and this field is what a reader must check before quoting "GATED".
     *
     * The one thing Amabie does NOT own is stated in the summary and in `gatingNeedsTrust`: Codex
     * runs a non-managed hook only after that hook definition has been reviewed and trusted once, so
     * until the user takes that step the file is written and nothing is gated.
