/**
 * Round-3 blocker 6 — INDEPENDENT verification of retained dependency-tree
 * snapshots.
 *
 * The Round-3 audit's core testing lesson: "using the same parser/classifier
 * in both producer and verifier does not prove correctness." The pipeline
 * flattens `npm ls --json` output recursively, hashes it, and DISCARDED the
 * bytes; nothing could later refute a resealed bundle's tree hashes, copy
 * counts, VALID status, or drift confinement. This module is the second
 * opinion: it re-derives every tree fact from the RETAINED raw artifact bytes
 * with a deliberately different implementation (iterative stack traversal,
 * its own version-extraction and subtree-containment logic, no shared code
 * with the pipeline's recursive walk or the comparator's diff), and reports
 * every disagreement with the bundle's claims.
 *
 * What verification here establishes: the bundle's tree facts are what the
 * retained bytes say they are (content integrity of the observation), and
 * the observation was complete (anomaly list re-derived, not merely
 * recorded). What it does NOT establish: that the bytes came from the same
 * npm invocation that ran the tests — that binding is the manifest digest
 * plus the artifact-directory checks in prove.ts (and remains
 * tamper-evidence, not authenticated provenance).
