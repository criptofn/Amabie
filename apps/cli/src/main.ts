 *   amabie setup    [--check] [--yes]        inspect setup or install + smoke-run
 *                                          (--check is read-only; READY only after proof)

 *                                          freezes at ITS isolation: registering
 *                                          afterwards adds duties but never mints
 *                                          it — that path is RE-ISOLATION
 *   amabie bind <script> --requirement "…"   the OPERATOR's act: declare that a stated
 *                                          requirement is proven by that sealed script.

 *                                          requirement stays NOT PROVEN (fail closed).
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 proof holds fully on the proof host / CONFIRMED_REGRESSION as expected
 *             1 proof failed / PASS
 *             2 other classification / infra / proof INCOMPLETE — host-exact
 *               assertions could not be verified because this runtime is not
 *               the committed proof host (round-3 B3; never a PASS pretense)
 *             2 also: onboarding NEEDS ATTENTION / UNSUPPORTED (onboarding never
 *               exits 0 without having executed and seen its checks pass)
 *             3 misuse / refused bundle / NOT-SELF-CONSISTENT report
 *               (report's exit 0 means the evidence is self-consistent with
 *               the local artifacts — post-sol F1: it does NOT mean the
 *               committed proof was consulted; only prove/check do that)

                            MCP defaults to four everyday tools; expert adds work/finish.
                            --toolchain (repeatable) finds a named tool on your shell PATH
                            and authorizes its executable directory (for example java or python).
                            --toolchain-dir (repeatable) authorizes ONE executable directory
                            for the checks your project runs: build tools a project spawns
                            itself (java, python, git) are invisible to Amabie's restricted
                            step environment on purpose, because a program planted earlier on
                            the calling PATH would run as Amabie's own authority. A directory
                            inside the repository is refused; --clear-toolchain-dirs revokes
  amabie status             lazy reconnect: does Amabie already know this repo, and is its
                            wiring sound? READ-ONLY — no project commands executed, zero
                            writes (a few read-only git metadata reads);
                            CONNECTED / NEEDS ATTENTION / NOT CONNECTED. A statement about

  amabie mcp [--profile everyday|expert]
                            MCP server on stdio; manual invocations default to the legacy expert profile
  amabie result             the same state answer as the status command, for PROGRAMS:
                            compact, versioned JSON on stdout (checks, sealed authority,
                            MEASURED custody level, harness capability, recent historical checks)
                            and no log dump — full evidence stays in the files the envelope
                            names. Never runs the plan, so it is free to call
  amabie agents             which agents work in this repo and at what capability:
                            GATED (a completion can be blocked — Claude Code, and
                            OpenAI Codex CLI once you trust the hook setup wrote)
                            vs ADVISORY (the agent is told and may ignore it).
                            "amabie agents install generic" adds a marked,
                            removable AGENTS.md instruction block; no command ever

                            EXPERIMENTAL: extract source-linked, UNCLEAR candidates for
                            review; optional Ollama mode accepts exact quotes only.
                            --suggest-criteria previews unreviewed ideas outside the request;
                            numeric values absent from the task are flagged for review.

                            requires explicit project-change authorization. A provider CLI
                            may consume its account quota or API billing. The default limit is 3.
  amabie doctor --check ID  re-runs one sealed check for diagnosis (PARTIAL only;
                            never a completion result). Run amabie doctor for the full gate.
  amabie doctor --prompt-evidence FILE
                            EXPERIMENTAL: evaluate each registered requirement using the
                            current full sealed-plan run; requires exact task registration,
                            complete source mapping, and sealed proof bindings; never accepts
                            an agent's success claim.
  amabie uninstall          remove Amabie's own changes, keep everything else
  amabie claim "<text>"     the agent's account, stored as an UNTRUSTED hint — claims
                            are not evidence; only Amabie's own runs decide verdicts
  amabie task "<intent>"    register task intent (--kind bugfix|refactor|dependency|
                            performance|ui|multi, --requirement per part) so completion
                            checks derive the task's proof obligations — a hint with zero
                            authority: it can only ADD obligations, never weaken the plan.
                            M10.2: at the candidate boundary the task FROZEN IN THE
                            CANDIDATE'S OWN RECORD at isolation is the authority to
                            judge completion at all — none frozen = NOT PROVEN, never
                            PASS, and registering after the fact cannot mint it:
                            register, then re-isolate (there is no opt-out)
  amabie profile list "<task>" | apply <id> "<task>"
                            an approved routine profile (committed amabie.profiles.json):
                            a matching task is registered and bound with the profile's
                            reviewed requirement; anything unmet stays a PROPOSAL, exit 2
  amabie bind <script> --requirement "<exact stated requirement>" [--requirement …] [--reseal]
                            the OPERATOR's binding act: declare that a stated requirement
                            is proven by a script the SEALED PLAN runs. Writes
                            package.json amabie.proofs (or amabie.project.json proofs) and
                            names the step that seals it ('amabie setup'). --reseal does the
                            whole ritual in one act: it commits the declaration FILE alone —
                            refusing if any other path is dirty, so the sealed base is
                            exactly what you reviewed — and then runs the seal. It saves two
                            commands, never authority: the script must already be part of the
                            sealed plan. Without a sealed binding a registered requirement
                            stays NOT PROVEN — acceptance cannot replace measurement for an
                            objective requirement. Task registration only adds duties;
                            LOCAL does not isolate same-UID workers from CLI bind/setup commands

                            trusted base (--base <ref>, --path <dir>) for a worker to
                            edit — the base itself is never the workspace

                            is applied), FAIL/BLOCKED/NOT-PROVEN leaves the base untouched;
                            a green plan alone never PASSes — §10 needs the task
                            frozen at THIS candidate's isolation to carry the duties
                            it derives from the live record (no frozen authority =
                            NOT PROVEN; recovery = register the task and re-isolate)

  amabie accept <name>      closes SUBJECTIVE duties (ui/performance/
                            dependency/requirements without their own check) by
                            typing the candidate's name in an interactive
                            terminal — the non-interactive agent path is
                            refused: no flag, no env escape. (A TTY is
                            friction, not cryptographic human identity —
                            see SECURITY.md.) Binds to the exact candidate
                            commit, base, frozen task, AND the acceptance-
                            eligible duty set at signing; any of those moving
                            makes it STALE and the duties reopen. Objective
                            proofs are never acceptance-material; mixed tasks
