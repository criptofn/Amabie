/**
 * AUDIT BLOCKER 6 (v1.5) — THE SEALED TOOLCHAIN, AND WHO IS TO BLAME WHEN A CHECK FAILS.
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS FILE EXISTS FOR, as the auditor reproduced it on commit a004f55 and as
 * tooling/probes/v15-realworld-gate-env.mjs measures on this host: a clean project whose declared
 * check is `npm test` → `java -version` PASSES outside Amabie and FAILS inside it, because a sealed
 * step child gets `sanitizedEnv` — `PATH` = the Node install dir + the OS-managed dirs, and nothing
 * else (12 entries against the shell's 41; `python`, `java`, `git` invisible; `JAVA_HOME` absent).
 * Amabie then printed *"That is your project talking, not Amabie."* — a FALSE attribution, because
 * the project's own command passes on the same host outside Amabie's restriction.
 *
 * TWO THINGS ARE FIXED HERE, AND THEY ARE DIFFERENT THINGS.
 *
 * 1. THE ATTRIBUTION. `attributeStepFailure` answers "is Amabie's own environment the cause?" from
 *    MEASUREMENTS, never from the shape of the output alone:
 *      - Amabie's own resolution refused the program (the step never ran): environment;
 *      - a toolchain directory the OPERATOR authorized at setup is gone: environment;
 *      - the child's output reports a program it could not find AND that program genuinely does not
 *        resolve in the directories the child was handed: environment.
 *    The third rule is deliberately two-sided. An agent that PRINTS "java: not found" from a failing
 *    test cannot move the message, because the same function walks the sealed directories itself and
 *    finds `java` where it belongs; and a program that npm's own script PATH provides (a project's
 *    `node_modules/.bin/tsc`, say) is not an environment problem either, so those directories are
 *    part of the walk. Nothing here changes a VERDICT — a failing check still fails, still
 *    `NEEDS ATTENTION`, still exit 2. What changes is that Amabie no longer blames the project for a
 *    restriction Amabie itself imposed, and the two outcomes now have different words:
 *      PROJECT CHECK FAILURE
 *      AMABIE SEALED ENVIRONMENT CANNOT RESOLVE REQUIRED TOOLCHAIN
 *
 * 2. THE NARROWEST WAY OUT. `trustedDirs()`/`resolveProgram` already pin the PROGRAM each step names
 *    to an absolute path, and that stays exactly as it was: the plan's own program is never resolved
 *    through PATH. What no pin can reach is the TRANSITIVE case this blocker is about — `npm test`
 *    spawns whatever the project's own scripts spawn (`java`, `python`, `git`), and that resolution
 *    happens inside the child, through the PATH the child was handed. So the operator can now name
 *    executable DIRECTORIES at setup (`amabie setup --toolchain-dir <dir>`); they are validated,
 *    sealed into the local config, and appended to the sealed step PATH after the Node install dir
 *    and the OS dirs. This is NOT the calling PATH: `process.env.PATH` is still ignored at
 *    verification time, a directory is authority only because a human named it at the one
 *    authorizing moment, and a directory the repository can write is refused outright, so a worker
 *    cannot authorize its own shim. Nothing is trusted merely because it is on PATH.
