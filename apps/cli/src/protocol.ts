/**
 * 1.1 §21/§26/§28 — the machine-readable protocol.
 *
 * Amabie is used by agents that are not Claude Code, and by CI systems that are
 * not agents at all. Prose is for humans; a stable, versioned, COMPACT JSON
 * envelope is the interface everything else parses. Two rules shape it:
 *
 *   1. `--json` never changes what Amabie DECIDES. It changes where the human
 *      prose goes (stderr) and puts exactly one JSON object on stdout. Exit
 *      codes are identical in both modes — an agent must never get a different
 *      verdict because it asked for JSON.
 *   2. The envelope carries FACTS and a next action, never a log dump. Full
 *      logs stay in the evidence files the envelope names; a completion payload
 *      that pastes megabytes into a model's context is a token bug, not a
 *      feature. `problems` and `checks` are deliberately short lists.
 *
 * The schemas are versioned strings so a consumer can detect a change instead
 * of silently misreading a field.
