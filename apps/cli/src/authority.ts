/**
 * M9 — authority guard (directive §9: the worker candidate must never control
 * its verifier). PROVEN FACT (tooling/probes/m9-lock-facts.mjs, measured on
 * node v26.7.0/win32): FileHandle has NO lock API, and a same-user process
 * can break anything the kernel offers anyway (kill the holder, rewrite the
 * ACL, rename the parent). So M9 makes NO prevention claim inside the window.
 * What it DOES claim, and enforces fail-closed:
 *   - the authority bytes are fingerprinted on BOTH edges of plan execution
 *     (drift between the edges ⇒ the verdict cannot be trusted);
 *   - a change can neither be scored by mutated bytes nor hide as a PASS:
 *     drift forces BLOCKED — the code path that would have said PASS is
 *     never reached;
 *   - evidence storage is authority too (§9 lists it): the WHOLE base
 *     evidence dir is fingerprinted as a tree, so a plan step cannot plant
 *     a forged PASS bundle, edit an observed one, or delete history inside
 *     the window (the M8 residual "prevention is M9's job" closes here).
 *     Amabie's own writes land OUTSIDE the window — pre-execution blocks
 *     write their bundle before the snapshot is taken, the verdict bundle
 *     lands after the re-read, pruning rides with it — so no self-trigger;
 *     a CONCURRENT amabie invocation inside another's window can force a
 *     false BLOCK, never a false PASS (fail-closed direction, same-user
 *     concurrency is the documented ceiling).
 * Review-hardened (this session's adversarial pass, fixes F1–F4): the
 * fingerprint set now covers the VERIFIER'S OWN CODE TREE (dist/src — every
 * byte of the import graph loads at process start, so an in-window write is
 * inert THIS run but would execute on the next one, including promote's
 * fresh re-verify); a tampering caught during/after a window also leaves a
 * persistent QUARANTINE marker (§9.5 below); the sealed-plan checks re-run
 * AFTER the window (npm re-reads the candidate's package.json at every
 * spawn, so step 1 rewriting step 2's sealed text must not slip through);
 * and the base's HEAD ref is a sandwich token (shared object/ref store means
 * a sealed step CAN move the base branch — gate 6's idempotent arm must
 * never read an attacker-moved ref as proof of a past apply).
 *
 * Detection-only ceilings, stated honestly: a change-and-revert strictly
 * between two reads cannot be seen (same limit as M8's identity sandwich);
 * an outside-the-window edit is the containment gate's pre-execution job
 * (harness entry) and every human-side job (doctor). The verdict binds the
 * bytes it read, not a promise nobody touched them afterwards.
 *
 * §9.5 QUARANTINE — a mandate is one window's memory unless it persists:
 * a byte-idempotent mutation (re-writing the same mutated bytes) re-baselines
 * clean in the NEXT window and launders into a PASS. So a during/after-
 * execution mandate stamps a marker file; verify and promote refuse to
 * judge at all while it exists; only a human re-running setup (whose fresh
 * writeConfig IS the re-seal) clears it. The marker deliberately does NOT
 * join the fingerprint list — existence short-circuits before any window
 * opens, so in-window deletion is unreachable. Same-UID ceiling, stated: the
 * code that could have restored every byte by hand can also delete the
 * marker by hand; what quarantine closes is the automated laundering path
 * (retry the same tampering verify and the mutated baseline says PASS).
