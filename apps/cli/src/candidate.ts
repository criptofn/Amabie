/**
 * M7 — UNTRUSTED CANDIDATE ISOLATION (git worktrees). Directive §7.
 *
 * The accepted tree is the TRUSTED BASE. A worker never edits it directly:
 * `amabie isolate <name>` opens a detached `git worktree` checkout of the
 * base's resolved commit, the worker works there, and Amabie verifies the
 * candidate from OUTSIDE it against the BASE's sealed authority. A PASS makes
 * the candidate ELIGIBLE for promotion — promotion is a separate act
 * (`--promote`, implemented in this file under M8); verify itself never
 * applies anything, and a FAIL leaves the base untouched.
 *
 * Which guarantee lives where (the probe proves each end to end on real git):
 *   1  accepted work never edited by the worker — the worktree is the only
 *      writable place; the base is touched solely by git worktree plumbing,
 *      the registry record under .amabie, and evidence bundles.
 *   2  candidate identity explicit — every bundle carries candidateIdentity
 *      (head/tree/dirty) of the candidate, plus candidateName/candidateRoot.
 *   3  baseline identity explicit — the record and bundle stamp baseRef/
 *      baseHead/baseTree from the live `git rev-parse` at isolation time.
 *   4/5 cannot impersonate / cannot inherit a parent repo — verification binds
 *      rec.root to this base by git-common-dir equality, and every git probe
 *      runs through gitWithinRoot (a parent never answers for a root).
 *   6  verifier authority outside candidate control — plan + seal are read
 *      from the BASE's config; drift is checked against the candidate's
 *      package.json BEFORE anything executes, so the candidate cannot redefine
 *      the check it is being given. pre/post lifecycle hooks around a sealed
 *      step and a candidate-side .npmrc are refused for the same reason: the
 *      seal covers only the listed script texts, and both execute outside
 *      them (npm/pnpm run hooks automatically; flags rewrite what runs).
 *   7  authoritative evidence outside candidate-writable scope — bundles land
 *      under the BASE's .amabie/evidence, never inside the candidate tree.
 *   8  FAIL leaves the trusted base untouched — proven byte-for-byte in the
 *      probe (base `git status --porcelain` identical after a failing verify).
 *   9/10 unrelated work never overwritten; dirty/ambiguous bases handled
 *      honestly — refuse-on-collision everywhere, and a dirty base isolates
 *      with an explicit note that uncommitted work is NOT in the candidate.
 *   11/15 cleanup is safe and never a destructive auto-reset — remove demands
 *      a valid record, refuses a dirty candidate without --discard, and never
 *      touches an unregistered path.
 *   12/13 worktrees/submodules/spaces/Unicode — worktree plumbing is spawned
 *      as argv arrays (no shell), names and --path accept spaces and Unicode;
 *      submodules are NOT initialized (the plan would half-verify silently),
 *      so a candidate whose COMMITTED tree carries a gitlink (ls-tree mode
 *      160000) is refused at verify — renaming or deleting .gitmodules cannot
 *      hide the committed half-empty checkout from the tree itself.
 *   14 interrupted sessions recover honestly — list derives status live from
 *      git probes (LOST / IMPOSTOR / ADVANCED / DIRTY / UNREGISTERED) and
 *      repairs nothing silently; bundles are never read back for verdicts.
 *
 * ponytail — known ceilings, stated not hidden: same-UID processes can write
 * anywhere; this layout stops the ACCIDENTAL and the git-scoped edit, not a
 * determined local attacker (M4's "no key exists" honesty applies here too).
 * M9 detects (and fails closed on) in-window authority writes; a
 * change-and-revert strictly between the two fingerprint reads stays as
 * invisible as it was under M8's identity sandwich — same thread, same limit.
 * gitignored deps and .amabie state do not ride the checkout. A candidate at
 * the DEFAULT path sits under the base, so module resolution walks up into
 * the BASE's node_modules — a pass there can mix base deps with candidate
 * code; a --path elsewhere inherits that location's own ancestors instead.
 * The verdict binds code identity, not the dependency tree (stated, not
 * fixed — a fake-green claim would be worse). Other tool configs beyond
 * .npmrc (jest/babel resolution) ride the tree the same way.
 * Gate order is message honesty: LOST before IMPOSTOR before tree probes — a
 * genuinely missing tree must not be reported as an impostor. An unsafe plan
 * script name throws before any spawn; verify catches it and blocks with a
 * bundle (ERROR exit 3 would never fake a PASS, but it wrote no evidence).
 * Each verify attempts a best-effort bundle, blocked attempts included; the global
 * EVIDENCE_KEEP cap is unchanged from pre-M7; bundles are never read back.
 *
 * M10 — proof obligations and trusted intent at the candidate boundary
 * (directive §10 + §11), both riding the gates above:
 *   - the ladder: after the plan runs green and the M9 sandwich is clean, the
 *     obligation engine judges the CANDIDATE diff (baseHead from the record —
 *     conflating cfg.baseline would blame the base's post-setup commits on the
 *     worker; the worktree started provably clean at isolation, so every
 *     deletion is attributable). Any UNMET → blocked bundle (steps included),
 *     any UNPROVEN → 'unproven' bundle + CANDIDATE NOT PROVEN — exit 2 and a
 *     null startHead, so M8 gate 1 can never launder a green-plan-unproven
 *     run into an apply. PASS only when every obligation is MET; FAIL bundles
 *     carry the obligation read as M11's repair fuel.
 *   - the intent guard: isolateCreate freezes { plan, script digests, task }
 *     into the record; before anything runs, verify refuses a candidate whose
 *     authority was weakened after isolation (dropped step, re-sealed text,
 *     shrunk task) with a blocked bundle carrying intentEvent. Increases are
 *     always allowed. Grudgeless like the pre-gate (the snapshot is frozen at
 *     record-write and the record is fingerprinted — no laundering vector).
 *
 * M9 — authority self-protection (directive §9: the candidate must never
 * control its verifier). The plan runs candidate-authored script text, so
 * in-window writes to authority are the attack — fingerprinted at both edges
 * of the execution window: BASE bytes (.amabie config, harness settings, this
 * candidate's registry record, the task intent, the CLI entry), the WHOLE
 * evidence store as a tree (closing M8's "plan step can write the base
 * evidence dir" residual), the VERIFIER'S OWN CODE TREE (dist/src — the judge
 * cannot be swapped to run mutated logic next time), and the base's HEAD REF
 * as a state token (refs are shared with worktrees; a moved base ref must
 * never read to gate 6 as a past apply). The candidate-side seal checks
 * (plan-text, lifecycle hooks, .npmrc) run at BOTH edges too: npm re-reads
 * package.json per spawn, so step 1 rewriting step 2's sealed text executes
 * unsealed words INSIDE the window without touching a single fingerprinted
 * base byte. Measured fact (tooling/probes/m9-lock-facts.mjs): this runtime
 * offers no mandatory locks — so M9 claims NO prevention and enforces
 * DETECTION AT BOTH EDGES, fail-closed: any drift forces AMABIE BLOCKED
 * COMPLETION (the PASS path is structurally never reached), a pre-execution
 * containment gate catches a harness entry stripped BEFORE the window, and
 * every event lands in a blocked bundle with both state tokens. A
 * during/after-execution mandate additionally STAMPS A QUARANTINE marker:
 * verify and promote then refuse the base outright until a HUMAN re-runs
 * setup (the re-seal is the clearing act) — otherwise the same byte-
 * idempotent mutation re-baselines clean in the next window and launders a
 * PASS over tampered authority. The pre-gate stays grudgeless (restore =
 * recovery, proven in the probe).
 *
 * M8 — promotion (NO PASS, NO APPLY; the apply act lives in isolatePromote):
 * a PASS only makes a candidate ELIGIBLE; `--promote` re-verifies LIVE
 * against the sealed plan and is the sole authority — stored bundles are
 * never read back, so old or forged evidence cannot authorize anything. The
 * act moves the base ONLY by `git merge --ff-only` onto the exact verified
 * commit, sandwiched by identity checks, and post-proves the applied tree
 * byte-for-byte. ponytail ceiling, stated not hidden: an edit-then-revert
 * strictly inside one plan run cannot be seen by a same-thread sandwich; the
 * fresh bundle's own step outputs are the human-visible record (M19/persist).
