/**
 * 1.1 §22 — the invisible workflow.
 *
 * The expert primitives (`task` → `isolate` → `isolate --verify` → `isolate
 * --promote`, with `accept` for subjective duties) are the trust boundary, and
 * they stay exactly as they are. What an ordinary user should not have to do is
 * remember them. This file is orchestration ONLY: every step delegates to the
 * primitive that owns it, so there is no second implementation of registration,
 * verification or promotion — and therefore no second place for a gate to be
 * weakened.
 *
 *   amabie work <name> "<intent>"     register the intent, open the candidate,
 *                                     tell the worker where to work and what
 *                                     will be demanded of it
 *   amabie finish <name>              verify the candidate from outside it, then
 *                                     promote IF the objective proof holds; if a
 *                                     subjective duty is open, stop and hand the
 *                                     decision to a human
 *
 * Two properties this must never lose:
 *   - `finish` promotes only what `isolate --verify` just proved, and promotion
 *     re-verifies LIVE on its own (the existing M8 rule). A stored PASS is never
 *     replayed.
 *   - `finish` never closes a subjective duty. Aesthetics and "feel" still need
 *     `amabie accept` in an interactive terminal, and the workflow says so
 *     instead of pretending a green plan was enough.

   * measures and that it therefore could never discharge: MEASURED at 1.5-1.85M tokens over 41-53

   * at +133% tokens against the plain arm).
   *
   * The information needed to prevent that exists the moment the task is registered, so it is used
   * HERE — before isolation, before the worker is told anything. The candidate is not opened and
   * nothing is spent.
   *
   * A registration that carries its OWN subjective marker is not blocked: acceptance is then a
   * real path and the state is honest rather than stalled. Only a requirement that asks for a
   * mechanical outcome with no check to measure it is refused.
