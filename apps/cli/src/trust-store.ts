/** Broker-side LOCAL store. A same-UID worker can replace key AND history.

 *
 * Merged with the 1.1 P0 review slice on this branch. Astra owns the seal
 * shape (strict ledger equality, CAS, fsync'd atomic writes, signed payloads
 * passed through authorityJson) and the SINGLE minting lock. This branch adds
 * back, on top of it:
 *   - the AMABIE_TRUST_STORE pointer (storeFromEnv) and projectIdForRoot, the
 *     two names setup/status/doctor are wired through;
 *   - a BOUNDED WAIT plus an explicit busy REFUSAL folded into Astra's lock —
 *     one lock, no nesting, and a lock is still NEVER stolen (a killed writer
 *     needs operator recovery, never an automatic reclaim);
 *   - the writability probe with a unique filename and a read-back check, and
 *     this branch's user-visible level reasons;
 *   - custody refusals that walk only components AT or UNDER the store root
 *     (a link-redirected temp root must not refuse every store on the host)
 *     while still naming what was refused: inconsistent keypairs, symbolic
 *     link or junction key material, hard-linked key material, reserved
 *     Windows device names.
