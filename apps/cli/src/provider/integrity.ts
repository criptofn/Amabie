/**
 * THE INTEGRITY BOUNDARY — an attempt at a real, non-privileged worker/authority separation.
 *
 * STATUS: Win32 restricted LOW child execution is measured available on this host.
 * This is write integrity only, not a production HARDENED provider.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A DIFFERENT MECHANISM FROM `boundary.ts`:
 *
 * `provider/boundary.ts` measures an IDENTITY boundary: a second OS account, a service
 * account, a DACL naming that account. Building one needs an administrator, which is why it
 * prints an install plan and executes nothing.
 *
 * This module was written to implement a MANDATORY INTEGRITY CONTROL boundary instead, which in
 * principle needs no privilege at all:
 *
 *   - a user may lower the integrity label of a directory they own (`icacls /setintegritylevel`);
 *   - a user may (in principle) start a process at a lower integrity level (`runas /trustlevel`);
 *   - and then the KERNEL — not Amabie, not a check, not a convention — refuses that process
 *     write access to the higher-integrity objects.
 *
 * WHAT WAS HISTORICALLY MEASURED BEFORE THE WIN32 HELPER (`tooling/probes/v12-integrity-boundary.mjs`, which writes its record
 * to the OS temp dir):
 *
 *   - applying the label WORKS: `icacls /setintegritylevel` succeeds on a directory this user owns;
 *   - starting a lowered process does NOT work on this host: `runas.exe` exits 1 with EMPTY stdout
 *     and stderr for EVERY input, including an invalid trust level and `/?`. Its exit code carries
 *     no information, so it must never be used as evidence;
 *   - therefore no confinement was established, no attack was executed, and the battery reports
 *     `ATTACKS BLOCKED: 0/0` rather than a number.
 *
 * A FALSE POSITIVE WAS FOUND AND RETRACTED HERE. The first version of the probe reported a working
 * boundary. It was wrong: its control write and its confined write used the SAME filename, so the
 * control's own success satisfied the confined check — the probe measured itself and called it a
 * boundary. The corrected probe gives every attempt a unique file, requires the CHILD's own pid in
 * the content, and reports a child that never ran as "not evidence of a boundary" rather than as
 * protection. See the audit trail in `docs/history/V1.2-PLAN.md`.
 *
 * CURRENT MEASUREMENT: the Win32 helper is tried before the historical runas fallback.
 * Its low child executes; the corrected attack battery measures 8/8 denied writes and 2/2
 * useful-work controls. Missing child evidence and ENOENT are never credited as protection.
 *
 * It is deliberately NOT wired into the product's decision path: `provider/boundary.ts` still owns
 * the six controls and `measuredCapabilities` is still the only producer of `HARDENED`. Importing
 * this module changes no verdict, and no product surface claims a level from it.

/**
 * Start a contained process and WAIT for it, then report what it did.
 *
 * WHY FILE EVIDENCE AND NOT A PIPE OR AN EXIT CODE — this is the part that is easy to get wrong,
 * and it was measured wrong first:
 *
 * `runas /trustlevel` launches the command through the Secondary Logon service and hands the
 * caller its OWN exit code, not the child's. Observed on the development host: `runas` reported
 * exit 1 with EMPTY stdout and stderr for a command that in fact STARTED and RAN. Reading that
 * refusal as "no boundary on this host" would have been a false negative — the boundary was there.
 *
 * So the child writes TWO facts: a launch marker (proving it ran at all) and the outcome of its
 * operation, both to files OUTSIDE the protected tree so that a confined child can still report.
 * The presence and content of those files cannot be faked by the launcher's exit code.
 *
 * @returns `{ ran, result, exitCode, output }` — `ran` is true only when the launch marker exists,
 *          which is the one fact that separates "the command ran and was refused" from "the command
 *          never ran". A caller must treat `ran: false` as NO EVIDENCE, never as protection.
