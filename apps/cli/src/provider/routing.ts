/**
 * PROVIDER-ONLY ROUTING for the two acts that can change the trusted base
 * (v1.1 Phase 3, item 4).
 *
 * THE HOLE THIS CLOSES: `accept` and promote were LOCAL, writable acts. On a
 * machine with a provider installed that is a bypass of the entire boundary — the
 * broker could hold the reviewer key, the kernel could refuse to mint it, and the
 * CLI would still let the same user write the acceptance record and
 * fast-forward the base. A security design whose enforcing process can be stepped
 * around by the process it is protecting is a design on paper.
 *
 * THE RULE, and it is deliberately a RULE rather than a preference: when a provider
 * is CONFIGURED here, these acts are minted by the broker or they do not happen.
 * There is no fallback, no retry against a local path, and no "provider was
 * unreachable so we did it ourselves" — every failure below is a refusal that
 * leaves the base untouched. When NO provider is configured, the ordinary local
 * behaviour is byte-for-byte what it was, so a machine without a provider is
 * unaffected (which is also why this cannot silently change v1.0 outcomes).
 *
 * What "configured" means is NOT re-decided here: `providerConfigured` is the one
 * definition (an enrolled worker identity is declared, or a broker token exists in
 * the store), and this module only asks it.
 *
 * WHAT EACH REFUSAL MEANS — the caller must surface the code, because they are
 * different facts and only one of them is a security event:
 *   connect-failed / timeout   no broker is running (activation incomplete)
 *   unauthorized               the caller does not hold this installation's token
 *                              (a token mismatch, or a store readable by someone
 *                              who should not have it)
 *   stale-generation           the broker serves a different authority generation,
 *                              so the ticket this act would consume cannot be
 *                              replayed into it
 *   candidate-mismatch         the broker's enrolled subject is a different
 *                              candidate or base than the one being acted on
 *   stale-proof                the broker holds no current passing verification
 *                              for this subject (the proof expired or never was)
 *   authority-mismatch         the subject/project the broker is bound to is not
 *                              this repository
 *   runner-not-installed /     the broker refuses to produce the statement at all
 *   no-restricted-runner       (measured: no separated runner identity exists yet)
