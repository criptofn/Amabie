/**
 * v1.3 §23 — the project's own check command, for OPT-IN per-batch feedback.
 *
 * Why this exists: the confined worker is launched ONCE and never told a verdict (MEASURED, see
 * tooling/probes/v13-transport-feedback.mjs), so it re-ran its own checks ~36 times and wrote a 58,587 B
 * fuzz rig to be sure — all of it inside one context that grows with every turn. Returning the project's
 * own check result after a batch removes the need to ASK, and the measured cost of doing so is ~45 ms per
 * run against 90 s of transport headroom (v13-transport-suite-cost.mjs).
 *
 * Three boundaries, deliberately:
 *   - it is the PROJECT'S OWN command (the sealed plan's tests step), not an Amabie verdict. Nothing here
 *     can mint a PASS, and the trusted completion gate is untouched;
 *   - it is OFF unless AMABIE_CONFINED_CHECK=1, so no recorded baseline moves while it is being measured;
 *   - it returns null rather than guessing when the config cannot be read, so a broken store degrades to
 *     "no feedback", never to a fabricated result.
