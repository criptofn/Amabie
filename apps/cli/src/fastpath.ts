/**
 * 1.1 §23 — the adaptive fast path: the DECISION half.
 *
 * The intent is that a README typo should not pay for a typecheck, a build and
 * the whole test suite. The only safe way to remove a check is if the PROJECT
 * declared which paths that check depends on and the change provably touched
 * none of them. So this file is deliberately the pure half of the feature:
 *
 *   - `validateStepPaths` checks a project's declaration before it is SEALED
 *     (setup refuses a malformed one, exactly like `amabie.proofs`);
 *   - `pathMatchesGlobs` answers "is this path inside the declared set?";
 *   - `decideFastPath` answers which steps must still run, and WHY for each one.
 *
 * It performs no I/O and no spawning, and it can only ever REMOVE work that a
 * declaration justifies. The rules that make it fail closed:
 *
 *   1. No declaration for a step ⇒ the step RUNS. There is no implicit default.
 *   2. A declaration exists ⇒ a step is skipped only when EVERY changed path is
 *      outside it. One changed path inside is enough to run the step.
 *   3. Nothing recorded as changed ⇒ everything RUNS. A skip needs a reason that
 *      can be shown to a human, and "we saw no change" is not one.
 *   4. Matching is case-INSENSITIVE and `**` matches zero or more segments, so a
 *      declaration matches MORE than a strict reader might expect. That is the
 *      conservative direction: more matching means fewer skips.
 *   5. Unknown step keys in a declaration are refused rather than ignored: a
 *      declaration for a check that is not in the plan is a mistake, and silently
 *      dropping it would leave the project believing it had declared something.
 *
 * Every decision carries a reason, because a skip that cannot explain itself is
 * indistinguishable from a check that was forgotten.
