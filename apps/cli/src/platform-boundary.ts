 * the anchored producer key, live-broker checked, and carrying raw evidence including
 * an unrestricted positive control and a real restricted attack). This function
 * is unchanged in what it accepts: a control that reads `available: false`, for
 * any reason, keeps `HARDENED` unreachable.
 *
 * The input is STRUCTURAL on purpose: this module is one of the five the P0
 * mutation probe copies into a scratch tree, so it must not import the provider
 * module (which lives outside that set). A caller passes the measurement it
 * already holds.
