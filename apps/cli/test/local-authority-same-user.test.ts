/**
 * v1.5 audit finding — LOCAL IS NOT WORKER-INDEPENDENT, AND THE UI MUST SAY SO.
 *
 * The auditor reproduced that a worker can run `amabie setup --yes` and re-seal its own
 * commit and plan at LOCAL. That is EXPECTED onboarding behaviour at LOCAL — `cmdSetup` has
 * never checked the caller's identity — but it is a CLAIM TOO STRONG if any surface a user or
 * an agent reads describes LOCAL proof as independent of the worker.
 *
 * So this file asserts the DIFFERENTIATION, semantically rather than by prose:
 *
 *   - the level a same-user host gets is LOCAL, and its text states the same-user limit AND
 *     the route that makes it true (the caller can re-run `amabie setup` and change what is
 *     checked), and denies worker-independence in words;
 *   - HARDENED is the level that adds a separate OS identity, it is only ever produced by a
 *     MEASUREMENT in which every boundary control is available, and the same text surface
 *     says it is not available here;
 *   - the two levels' statements are mutually exclusive: the LOCAL text claims same-user, the
 *     HARDENED text claims the opposite, and neither can be substituted for the other.
 *
 * Exact wording is deliberately NOT pinned: these assertions are about what the text MEANS,
 * so the claims can be re-phrased without weakening the test — but they cannot be removed.
