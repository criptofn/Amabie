/**
 * v1.5 AUDIT BLOCKER 6 — sealed toolchain and truthful failure attribution.
 *
 * The probe (tooling/probes/v15-sealed-toolchain.mjs) measures the PRODUCT end to end on this host.
 * This suite pins the MECHANISM the product rests on, so a later edit cannot quietly turn a
 * measurement back into a guess:
 *
 *  - the sealed step environment is BUILT (Node install dir + OS dirs) and an operator-authorized
 *    directory is only ever APPENDED, never substituted for the trusted dirs;
 *  - `extraPathDirs` fails closed on a relative or missing directory, and is absent by default (so
 *    every child environment built before this change is byte-identical);
 *  - the attribution rules: environment only when the child named a program that genuinely does not
 *    resolve in the directories the child was handed, and never because the output merely says so;
 *  - a path with SPACES survives validation, sealing and the child's PATH verbatim;
 *  - git / node / npm resolve through an authorized directory on ANY host (they are what this repo
 *    itself requires), while python and java are asserted only where this host actually has them —
 *    and when it does not, the test says so instead of passing quietly.
