/**
 * v1.5 — the focused regression for the two `amabie provider status` changes.
 *
 * MEASURED before the change, on a host with no measured deployment: the six
 * control lines each printed ~430 characters that said one thing twice —
 *
 *   authorityCustody — the confined-caller deployment is not measured: no
 *   confined-caller deployment has been measured in this store (expected <path>);
 *   the record reports: no confined-caller deployment has been measured in this
 *   store (expected <path>); the identity path also leaves it unavailable: …
 *
 * — and the command never plainly answered the two questions a user has: "is
 * HARDENED real here?" and "was this host measured at all?".
 *
 * What these tests assert is deliberately about SEMANTICS, not wording where the
 * wording is prose: that the duplication is gone, that every required answer is
 * present, and — the part that matters for trust — that NO output claims
 * HARDENED while the controls are not measured. They do not snapshot the prose,
 * so the output can be improved again without rewriting them.
