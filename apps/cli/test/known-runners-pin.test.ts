/**
 * Post-GLM panel K — the pin table must never drift from the bytes it names.
 *
 * KNOWN_RUNNER_RELEASES is the ONLY authority that says "these runner bytes
 * may receive Amabie's observer". The canary-double entry names files that
 * LIVE IN THIS REPO, so the equality table==disk is checkable here on every
 * platform: editing the double without re-pinning (or re-pinning a hash no
 * checkout produces) fails this test, not a confusing mid-e2e ABSENT.
 * (The real-mocha entries have no repo bytes to hash, but they are NOT
 * self-certifying: support/known-runners-manifest.test.ts recomputes each
 * npm pin from a committed review manifest of the registry tarball, and the
 * golden proof end-to-end-checks it against a live install.)
