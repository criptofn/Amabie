/**
 * REQUIREMENT COVERAGE — every authorized requirement is proven or NOT PROVEN.
 *
 * The invariant, in the owner's words: *Every objective requirement must have a frozen proof
 * obligation or remain NOT PROVEN. Subjective requirements require explicit human acceptance.*
 *
 * These are PURE unit tests of the obligation engine (`obligationsFor`), because that is where the
 * decision lives: no CLI run, no git, no filesystem. The end-to-end behaviour (doctor's verdict, the
 * Stop hook's block) is proven by `tooling/probes/requirement-coverage-gate.mjs`.
 *
 * MEASURED gap these pin: the binding map (`package.json` `amabie.proofs`) accepted any
 * requirement digest, but the obligation engine only credited digests that happened to be numeric
 * objective targets — so a plain stated requirement could never be covered by measurement, and the
 * only reachable end state was human acceptance.
