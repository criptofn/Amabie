/**
 * The Amabie NODE:TEST REPORTER — the exact bytes Amabie writes (byte-stable)
 * into its workspace and adds to a `node --test` invocation as a second reporter.
 *
 * WHY: strong observation must stop being functionally Mocha-only. `node --test`
 * is the Node runtime's own runner, so it needs no install, no package, and no
 * pin table — but its default output is TEXT, and text is a claim. This reporter
 * is Amabie's own bytes loaded INSIDE the test-runner process, receiving the
 * runner's own lifecycle events, and writing NDJSON frames on fd 3 exactly like
 * the mocha and Python channels.
 *
 * HOW IT IS ADDED, and why that shape matters:
 *   node --test --test-reporter=tap --test-reporter-destination=stdout \
 *              --test-reporter=<this file> --test-reporter-destination=stderr
 * The TAP reporter still writes the ordinary text summary to STDOUT, so the
 * cross-channel agreement check compares Amabie's frames against output Amabie did
 * NOT produce. This reporter writes nothing to its own stream; its evidence goes
 * to fd 3, a pipe handed only to this child.
 *
 * EVERY RULE BELOW IS A MEASUREMENT, not a reading of the docs
 * (`tooling/probes/node-test-reporter-events.mjs` prints the raw stream; probe
 * results on node 26.7.0, single- AND multi-file):
 *  1. Reporter events carry `data.name` and `data.testId`; **`data.testName` does
 *     not exist**. An id derived from `testName` never matches a `test:start`, so
 *     every pass would be rejected as `no-run` — which is exactly what the first
 *     version of this file did, and why the probe exists.
 *  2. A SKIPPED or TODO test arrives as **`test:pass` carrying `skip:`/`todo:`**,
 *     not as `test:skip`/`test:todo` (those types were never emitted). Counting
 *     such an event as a pass makes the frames disagree with the runner's own
 *     `# pass N` / `# skipped N` and the round fails closed; it is counted as
 *     `pending` instead.
 *  3. `node --test <dir>` reports NO file-level start/pass/fail — only the tests
 *     (measured with 2 files, 4 tests, one failing). So no file-filtering
 *     heuristic is needed and none is invented.
 *  4. A parent suite whose child failed emits its OWN `test:fail`
 *     (`failureType: 'subtestsFailed'`) and the runner counts it in `# fail N`
 *     too, so counting it keeps the two channels in exact agreement.
 *  5. `test:start` precedes its `test:pass`/`test:fail`; `test:complete` arrives
 *     BEFORE `test:start` and is ignored.
 *
 * WHAT IT PROVES AND WHAT IT DOES NOT:
 *  1. Lifecycle ground truth is `test:start` + `test:pass`/`test:fail` TOGETHER: a
 *     pass for a test whose start Amabie never watched is REJECTED (a `reject`
 *     frame fails the round closed). Printing is not executing.
 *  2. `hello` carries pid, ppid, node version, the observer version and the
 *     per-round nonce; the parent requires the nonce to round-trip and (pid or
 *     ppid) to be the process it spawned.
 *  3. NO secret is injected and the honest ceiling is unchanged: code inside the
 *     observed process can emulate these frames (documented residual). What is
 *     structurally dead is certifying execution from TEXT ALONE.
 *  4. fd 3 is closed exactly once, after `bye`.
