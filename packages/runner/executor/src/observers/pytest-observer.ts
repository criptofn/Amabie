/**
 * The Amabie PYTEST OBSERVER — the exact bytes Amabie writes (byte-stable) into
 * its workspace and has pytest import as a plugin before any test runs.
 *
 * WHY (v1.1 Phase 2): pytest is the other half of the Python world, and it is not
 * observable the way `unittest` is. `unittest` is hooked through
 * `sitecustomize`/`TestResult`; pytest has a plugin API, so Amabie injects a
 * plugin. Everything else — the frames, the protocol, the trust argument — is the
 * SAME channel as mocha, `unittest` and `node --test`, deliberately: one
 * observation vocabulary, four loaders.
 *
 * THE INJECTION POINT: `PYTEST_PLUGINS` (an environment value Amabie computes)
 * plus the plugin's directory on `PYTHONPATH`. Both come from Amabie's own
 * workspace — `sanitizedEnv` has no env-merge path (audit F9), and the variable
 * NAME is fixed by the injection kind, so no subject string can reach the child's
 * environment through this door. `-p` on argv was REJECTED as the primary
 * mechanism because plugin suppression (`-p no:<name>`) can also be written into a
 * project's `addopts`, so argv would be the weaker door of the two; the round
 * refuses an explicit `-p no:canary_pytest_observer` and a config-suppressed
 * observer simply produces no frames, which fails the round closed.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES THE OBSERVATION TRUSTWORTHY, and what does not
 * (`tooling/probes/pytest-observer-events.mjs` prints the raw hooks this rests on):
 *  1. Ground truth is `pytest_runtest_logstart` + the item's PHASE REPORTS
 *     TOGETHER. An item's outcome is decided once, at `teardown` — pytest's own
 *     per-item counting — so a report for an item whose start Amabie never watched
 *     is REJECTED (`reject`), and printed or reported text cannot mint a count.
 *  2. The phase mapping is MEASURED, not assumed (pytest 9.1.1):
 *       pass    : setup passed, call passed, teardown passed
 *       fail    : call failed
 *       error   : setup failed   (pytest's `error` category; a failure for us)
 *       skip    : setup skipped, NO call report
 *       xfail   : call skipped with `wasxfail` set
 *       xpass   : call passed WITH `wasxfail` set — a pass in a strict sense but
 *                 NOT in pytest's summary (`# xpassed`), so it is `pending` here,
 *                 and a STRICT xpass arrives as call failed and is counted as one
 *     A failing teardown wins over a passing call, because pytest reports that
 *     item as an error and the text channel must agree with the frames.
 *  3. Every hook body is guarded; a broken hook emits one `adapter-error` frame and
 *     degrades silently. The observer must never change what the suite does.
 *  4. NO secret is injected, and the honest ceiling is the same as the `unittest`
 *     channel and HIGHER than the node one: pytest runs the tests in ITS OWN
 *     process, so subject code can write to fd 3 and emulate frames. Lifecycle
 *     pairing is what makes that visible (a forged pass with no watched start is a
 *     `reject`, and a forged bye disagrees with the recount) — not secrecy.
 *  5. fd 3 is closed exactly once, after `bye`.
 *
 * NOT SUPPORTED, stated rather than hoped: `pytest-xdist` runs items in worker
 * processes whose frames do not belong to this pipe, so an xdist run fails closed
 * (duplicate/absent frames) rather than being credited. Collection errors are
 * pytest's own `error` category at FILE level; Amabie watched no item start, so the
 * frames cannot agree with the text and the round is INVALID — fail closed, never a
 * silent pass.
 *
 * The source is a template with no interpolated host data, so the bytes are
 * identical on every machine: a byte-compare in `ensurePytestObserver` is what
 * makes "the loaded bytes are Amabie's" checkable at all.
