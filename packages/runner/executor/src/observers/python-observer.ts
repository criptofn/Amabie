/**
 * The Amabie PYTHON OBSERVER — the exact bytes Amabie writes (byte-stable) into
 * its workspace and makes the interpreter import before any project code runs.
 *
 * WHY (v1.1 Phase 2): the strong-label contract was structurally "pinned mocha".
 * Every non-Node ecosystem could therefore never earn PASS / CONFIRMED_REGRESSION
 * / FLAKY / PRE_EXISTING_FAILURE, because a strong label requires a VALID
 * execution observation and there was no channel to observe one with. This file
 * gives Python one, using the same protocol and the same trust reasoning as
 * `observer-preload.ts` (the mocha channel) so there is ONE observation
 * vocabulary rather than two.
 *
 * THE INJECTION POINT: `sitecustomize`. CPython's `site` module imports a module
 * named `sitecustomize` at interpreter startup, before the command line runs and
 * therefore before any test module is imported. Amabie owns it by putting a
 * directory containing these bytes on the child's `PYTHONPATH` — an environment
 * value Amabie computes from its own workspace, never anything a subject
 * supplies (`sanitizedEnv` has no env-merge path, deliberately: audit F9).
 *
 * WHAT MAKES THE OBSERVATION TRUSTWORTHY, and what does not:
 *  1. Lifecycle ground truth is `TestResult.startTest` + `addSuccess`/`addFailure`
 *     TOGETHER: a success reported for a test whose `startTest` Amabie never
 *     watched is REJECTED (`reject` frame, which fails the round closed). Printing
 *     or reporting is not execution.
 *  2. Every hook body is guarded, and a broken hook emits exactly one
 *     `adapter-error` frame and then degrades silently. The observer must never
 *     change what the suite does.
 *  3. `hello` carries pid, parent pid, interpreter version, observerVersion and
 *     the per-round nonce Amabie put in the child's observer environment. WHY NOT
 *     PID ALONE: on Windows a virtualenv's `python.exe` re-executes the base
 *     interpreter as a CHILD, so `os.getpid()` is legitimately not the pid Node
 *     spawned — a strict pid equality check would make every venv round INVALID.
 *     The binding is therefore "nonce matches AND (pid OR ppid is the spawned
 *     process)": the nonce proves the frames came from THIS spawn's process tree,
 *     which is the property the pid check was for. The nonce is not a secret (a
 *     process can read its own environment) and is not claimed to be one; the
 *     in-process-emulation ceiling is unchanged and documented below.
 *  4. NO secret is injected. The honest ceiling is the same as mocha's: code
 *     running inside the observed process can emulate these frames. What is
 *     structurally dead is certifying execution from TEXT ALONE — the exact
 *     counterexample this whole subsystem exists because of
 *     (`node -e "console.log('128 passing (1s)')"`).
 *  5. fd 3 is closed exactly once, on interpreter exit, after `bye` is written.
 *
 * The source is kept as a template with no interpolated host data so the bytes
 * are identical on every machine: a byte-compare in `ensurePythonObserver` is
 * what makes "the loaded bytes are Amabie's" checkable at all.
