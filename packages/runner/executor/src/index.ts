/**
 * Audit B5 (supersedes the F8 blacklist posture) — AMABIE OWNS the
 * package-manager command surface. Blacklisting npm aliases is a treadmill
 * (`ins`, `ii`, `add`, `it`, `ait`, `dedupe`, … — any alias not enumerated is
 * a silent no-injection hole, and the pre-F8 code only knew four). The policy
 * is instead a CLOSED ALLOWLIST with fail-closed rejection:
 *
 *  1. only the `$npm` / `$yarn` tokens may invoke a package manager at all —
 *     raw forms (`npm`, `npm.cmd`, `npx`, `yarn`, `node …/npm-cli.js`) are
 *     REJECTED before execution, so a spec cannot smuggle an unpolicied
 *     invocation past the guard;
 *  2. the subcommand must be on the closed allowlist; ANYTHING ELSE
 *     (including vetted-looking but unlisted aliases, `exec`, `publish`,
 *     `link`, `rebuild`) is REJECTED as unsupported rather than run without
 *     policy;
 *  3. install/update family → Amabie's isolation controls are APPENDED AS
 *     THE ARGV SUFFIX (post-sol RB-1: npm's CLI config layer is last-wins,
 *     so the final canonical occurrence is the EFFECTIVE one), and a `--`
 *     separator is rejected in these families so nothing can follow the
 *     suffix (which would otherwise turn it into dead weight);
 *  4. script/info families run without injection (own pinned scripts /
 *     read-only queries); `--` passthrough only exists after such a
 *     subcommand, where the subcommand is already positionally pinned;
 *  5. the F8 grammar rules stay: short options rejected, isolation-
 *     conflicting flags rejected in ANY position, unknown bare options before
 *     the subcommand rejected (option names case-folded);
 *  6. (round-3 B5) LITERAL spec executables are allowlisted: only `node` may
 *     start a non-token command — wrappers (cmd/powershell/env/sh/xargs/…),
 *     package-manager frontends (pnpm/bun/corepack/volta/…) and every other
 *     unenumerated executable are refused fail-closed, because their first
 *     token is not what they execute;
 *  7. (post-sol RB-1) OPTION SPELLINGS ARE POLICIED SEMANTICALLY, not
 *     textually. Empirically derived on npm 11.16/11.19 (pinned by an
 *     executed probe in executor.test.ts): npm's CLI layer applies
 *     unique-prefix ABBREVIATIONS (--ig → --ignore-scripts, --userc →
 *     --userconfig, --reg → --registry), `--no-` NEGATIONS, and
 *     LAST-WINS ordering within the CLI config layer — while ambiguous
 *     abbreviations, case variants and unknown flags are ignored with a
 *     warning. An exact-string denylist therefore cannot protect: every
 *     spelling-equivalent of a denied name is an open door. The fix closes
 *     the whole equivalence class from BOTH ends:
 *
 *     (a) INSTALL-FAMILY OPTION SURFACE IS A CLOSED ALLOWLIST of exact
 *         vetted spellings (NPM/YARN_INSTALL_OPTION_ALLOW). A token is
 *         accepted only if its case-folded name (before '=') matches an
 *         allow entry literally — abbreviations, camelCase, negations of
 *         unlisted keys and every unknown config (including the per-package
 *         family --@scope:registry / //…:_auth) are REJECTED, not parsed.
 *         Value-taking entries require the `=` form, so no user token can
 *         swallow a following argv slot. The allowlist is property-tested
 *         prefix-DISJOINT from the protected key universe: no accepted
 *         spelling can abbreviate or negate INTO a protected key.
 *
 *     (b) AMABIE'S PROTECTED FLAGS ARE APPENDED LAST (argv suffix). npm's
 *         CLI layer is last-wins (probe-verified), so even a hypothetical
 *         future leak of a same-key spelling cannot change the EFFECTIVE
 *         configuration: Amabie's canonical occurrence is the final one.
 *         `--` and short options remain rejected in this family, so nothing
 *         user-supplied can follow the block.
 *
 *     (c) NON-INSTALL FAMILIES (script/info, no injected config) keep the
 *         open-option posture (specs pass their own flags / `--` payloads),
 *         but the conflict check now RESOLVES spellings: any token whose
 *         case-folded, one-`no-`-stripped name is a PREFIX of a protected
 *         key (exact spellings included) is rejected, as is the whole
 *         per-package config family. `--userc` cannot retarget a run
 *         script's npmrc anymore either.
 *
 * Invariant (property-tested): IF an install-family command is accepted,
 * the executed argv ENDS with exactly one canonical occurrence of each of
 * --ignore-scripts, --userconfig, --cache, --registry (and the hygiene
 * pair), after every user-controlled token — so the EFFECTIVE package-
 * manager configuration of those keys is Amabie's by npm's own semantics.
