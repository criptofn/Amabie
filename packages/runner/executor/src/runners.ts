/**
 * Provider-neutral runner-observation registry.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (v1.1 item A): the strong-label contract was never runner
 * neutral — it was mocha. `validateObservation` names mocha's fields
 * (`expectedMochaVersion`, `observedMochaVersion`), the injection decision is
 * `mochaBin !== undefined`, and the pin table has exactly one real runner. The
 * consequence is the honest gap `docs/EXECUTION-AUTHORITY.md` records: every
 * other runner (jest, vitest, ava, `node --test`, pytest, cargo, go) cannot
 * reach PASS / CONFIRMED_REGRESSION / FLAKY / PRE_EXISTING_FAILURE, because a
 * strong label requires a VALID execution observation and there is no channel
 * to observe with.
 *
 * That gap is CORRECT — it is the fail-closed floor doing its job. What was
 * missing is that the gap was implicit: nothing in the code said "this runner
 * is registered, and here is exactly why it cannot be strong". So this module
 * makes the decision explicit, per runner, in ONE place, and makes it
 * impossible to claim a capability nobody implemented.
 *
 * THE INVARIANT THAT MATTERS: `capability: 'STRONG'` may only be set for a
 * runner that really has (a) an injected observer whose bytes are Amabie's and
 * (b) an AUTHORITY that binds those bytes to a runner the operator or Amabie
 * itself can vouch for. Since v1.1 Phase 2 the authority is one of THREE kinds,
 * because runners are not all the same kind of artifact:
 *
 *   package-pin        the runner's release bytes match a pin in THIS repo
 *                      (mocha). Checked against KNOWN_RUNNER_RELEASES, which must
 *                      carry an npm-origin release.
 *   runtime-identity   the runner IS the runtime Amabie is executing on
 *                      (`node --test`). There is no "which one did the operator
 *                      authorize?" question: expansion refuses any `node` whose
 *                      realpath is not `process.execPath`.
 *   operator-identity  the runner is neither: a Python interpreter or a pytest
 *                      installation on this host. Its identity (version + a
 *                      content digest of its own bytes) is MEASURED by Amabie and
 *                      must be granted — in the product, by the operator's sealed
 *                      setup plan (apps/cli/src/runner-authority.ts).
 *
 * A non-package-pin STRONG row must also name the `channelModule` that implements
 * its loader and a `measuredOn` statement, and `runners.test.ts` checks that the
 * module EXISTS on disk — so a capability cannot be claimed without a channel a
 * reviewer can open, and "blocked" stays distinguishable from "not tried".
 *
 * UNKNOWN IS A FIRST-CLASS ANSWER. `resolveRunnerAdapter` returns null for a
 * runner nobody registered, and `observationCapabilityFor` turns that into
 * INCONCLUSIVE_ONLY with `runner-unverified`. That is how "unknown/unverified
 * runner ⇒ INCONCLUSIVE, never fabricated strong proof" is made structural
 * rather than a matter of remembering.
