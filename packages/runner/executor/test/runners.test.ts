/**
 * Provider-neutral runner observation — the registry cannot lie about itself.
 *
 * What these tests pin (v1.1 item A, extended in Phase 2):
 *  1. The STRONG set is EXACTLY `{mocha, node-test, pytest, unittest}` — every one
 *     of them backed by a channel whose bytes are Amabie's and an authority that
 *     binds it. Adding a runner is a claim about IMPLEMENTATION, so it must fail
 *     here until the evidence exists — that is the point.
 *  2. Every STRONG row on a non-package authority names a `channelModule` that
 *     EXISTS on disk: a capability nobody can open is not a capability.
 *  3. The remaining runners resolve to INCONCLUSIVE_ONLY with a stated reason, and
 *     unknown runners do too. A strong label can never be reached through an
 *     unobserved runner.
 *  4. `runnerRegistryProblems()` is empty: no STRONG without an authority, no
 *     INCONCLUSIVE_ONLY without a reason, no duplicate claims.
 *  5. Resolution is deterministic and totality holds (no input throws).
 *  6. Every declared protocol AGREES with the implemented OBSERVER_VERSION — the
 *     declaration cannot drift from the implementation it describes.
