 * CANONICAL FILESYSTEM IDENTITY — the one door for "are these the same object?".

 * WHY THIS EXISTS (v1.4, MEASURED). On Windows a single filesystem object can have
 * TWO textual spellings: its long name and its 8.3 SHORT alias
 * (`C:\Users\runneradmin\...` vs `C:\Users\RUNNER~1\...`). A short alias exists only
 * when a component does not fit 8.3, which is why this is invisible on many
 * machines — `Johannes` is exactly 8 characters, so that path has no distinct
 * alias. GitHub Actions runners set `TEMP=C:\Users\RUNNER~1\...`, and any user's
 * temp, checkout or install path can do the same.
 *
 * `fs.realpathSync` is NOT enough for identity comparisons: the JavaScript
 * implementation follows symlinks and junctions but returns the SHORT spelling
 * unchanged. `fs.realpathSync.native` is the OS call (`GetFinalPathNameByHandle`
 * on Windows, `realpath(3)` elsewhere) and DOES return the canonical long form.
 * MEASURED: short `...\CAA02B~1\A-LONG~1` -> long `...\canary-shortname-iZPuS2\a-long-directory-name`.
 *
 * WHAT WENT WRONG WITHOUT IT: Amabie compared a canonical root against a
 * git-reported long path, or a stored identity against a freshly read one, saw two
 * different strings for one object, and refused. That direction is fail-closed —
 * no boundary was ever crossed — but it is a FALSE REFUSAL, and in the worst case
 * it made every candidate/isolation/promotion path unusable on such a host.
 *
 * THE RULE, so this does not become "replace every path call":
 *   - Use these functions ONLY where two filesystem IDENTITIES are compared, or
 *     where an identity is PERSISTED to be compared later.
 *   - Do NOT use them for display, for joining, for lexically resolving a
 *     not-yet-existing destination, or for sanitising text.
 *   - Containment is unchanged: callers still ask whether one canonical path is
 *     inside another. Canonicalising both sides cannot widen a boundary, because
 *     a short alias and its long name are the SAME object by definition.
 *
 * FAIL-CLOSED: every function here returns null/false rather than guessing when a
 * path cannot be resolved. A nonexistent path is never silently accepted as an
 * identity.
