/**
 * KNOWN_RUNNER_RELEASES — Amabie's pin table for runner packages whose bytes
 * we trust enough to inject our lifecycle observer into (post-GLM panel AM-1).
 *
 * WHY A PIN TABLE AND NOT "just read the version": the injection trigger and
 * the expected runner version were both, before this, consumed from
 * FIXTURE/node_modules/<pkg>/package.json — a SUBJECT-CONTROLLED file. A
 * downstream repo can ship (or prepare-create) a mocha-API double whose
 * package.json says whatever npm would resolve, so every version-derived
 * check matched BY CONSTRUCTION and Amabie's own observer certified zero real
 * tests. Binding trust to (name, version, canonical tree hash) that live in
 * THIS repo moves the decision to Amabie-derived data: unpinned bytes ⇒ no
 * injection ⇒ observation ABSENT ⇒ strong labels structurally unreachable.
 *
 * TRUST POSTURE (docs/EXECUTION-AUTHORITY.md keeps the long form): this is TOFU by
 * code review, not signature verification — no cryptographic trust root
 * exists, and this file does not pretend otherwise. The hash proves the bytes
 * ARE THE BYTES WE REVIEWED; who those bytes came from is registry trust we
 * state honestly.
 *
 * Adding support for a new runner version = one entry AND its review
 * manifest: download the exact tarball from the pinned registry, verify it
 * against the registry's declared dist.integrity, generate a per-file
 * manifest (same walk rules as treeSha256) under
 * packages/support/test/fixtures/runner-manifests/, and pin the hash that
 * manifest recomputes to. known-runners-manifest.test.ts fails offline if
 * table and reviewed bytes diverge — a one-off "paste what the probe
 * printed" without a committed manifest is how a stale hash once shipped
 * (2f4a706 recorded 68a0a02c… for mocha@10.8.2, which matches no install;
 * the golden proof correctly degraded to INCONCLUSIVE, never a false PASS).
 * The live golden proof end-to-end-checks the pin against what the fixture
 * actually resolves.
